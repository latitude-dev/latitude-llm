## 🌈 Why Latitude?

Latitude is an open-source platform for both AI agents and prompt engineering. 
It covers the entire lifecycle: from design and testing to deployment, observability, and scaling.  

**Key features include:**

- **Collaborative Design** → version prompts and agents with your team  
- **Playground** → test interactively with different inputs, parameters, and configurations  
- **Evaluations** → choose from built-in evals, use LLM-as-judge, or add human-in-the-loop  
- **AI Gateway** → deploy as API endpoints that stay up-to-date with published changes  
- **Logs & Observability** → monitor costs, latency, and performance in real time  
- **Experiments** → run controlled tests across models and providers  
- **Datasets** → manage test data for batch evaluations and regression testing  
- **Integrations** → connect with 2,500+ tools

## ⚡ Quick start

Latitude offers two deployment options:

1. **Latitude Cloud**: A fully managed solution that allows you to get started quickly without worrying about infrastructure.
2. **Latitude Self-Hosted**: An open-source version that you can deploy and manage on your own infrastructure for complete control and customization.

Choose the option that best fits your needs and follow the corresponding instructions below.

### Latitude Cloud  
To get started with Latitude, follow these steps:  

1. **Sign up for Latitude** → Visit our [website](https://latitude.so) and create your account.
   
3. **Create a new project** → Once logged in, create a project to organize your agents, prompts, and evaluations.
   
5. **Build your first agent or prompt** →  
   - *Agent*: use the Editor to configure a simple workflow or autonomous agent.  
   - *Prompt*: start with a basic task, like generating a short story or answering a question.
     
6. **Test in the playground** → Run prompts or agents interactively with different inputs and observe responses.
   
8. **Evaluate in batch** → Upload a dataset and run evaluations to measure performance across scenarios.
   
10. **Deploy** → Publish your prompt or agent as an endpoint for easy integration with your applications.
    
12. **Monitor and evaluate** → Use Logs & Observability to review performance, costs, and latency over time.
    
14. **Iterate and improve** → Refine prompts or agents based on evaluation results, or create new versions.
    
16. **Collaborate with your team** → Invite team members to your Latitude workspace to collaborate on building, testing, and improving.  

For more details on each step, see our [documentation](https://docs.latitude.so) or join the [community](https://join.slack.com/t/trylatitude/shared_invite/zt-35wu2h9es-N419qlptPMhyOeIpj3vjzw).  

### Latitude Self-Hosted

Follow the instructions in the [self-hosted guide](https://docs.latitude.so/guides/self-hosted/production-setup) to get started with Latitude Self-Hosted.

After setting up Latitude Self-Hosted, you can follow the same steps as in the Latitude Cloud guide to create, test, evaluate, and deploy your prompts.
