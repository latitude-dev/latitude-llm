/**
 * Returns a factory bound to a specific Hono `Env` and mount prefix. Endpoints
 * created by the factory know where they'll be mounted on the parent router, so
 * {@link mountHttp} simultaneously serves the HTTP route AND registers the
 * endpoint with the MCP registry under that prefix — no separate
 * "mount + register" helper at the parent.
 *
 * The prefix MUST match the path the resulting sub-app is later mounted at via
 * `parent.route(prefix, subApp)`. The route file is expected to export the
 * prefix as a constant (e.g. `export const apiKeysPath = "/api-keys"`) and pass
 * it both here and to the parent — so the value is declared once.
 *
 * Accepts either Hono-style `:param` syntax or OpenAPI-style `{param}` syntax;
 * the registry stores the OpenAPI form so the dispatcher only has to substitute
 * one placeholder shape. This lets route files declare a single Hono-form
 * constant (`/projects/:projectSlug/annotations`) usable both at the parent
 * mount and here.
 *
 * The two-step shape (`defineApiEndpoint<E>(prefix)(args)`) exists because
 * TypeScript can't partially-infer one type argument while accepting another
 * explicitly: we need the caller to specify `Env` (which depends on which
 * sub-app the endpoint will mount under — e.g. `OrganizationScopedEnv` for
 * `/api-keys`, `ProjectScopedEnv` for `/projects/{slug}/scores`) while letting
 * the route shape `R` infer from `args.route`. The outer call fixes `E` and
 * captures the prefix; the inner call infers `R`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * export const apiKeysPath = "/api-keys"
 * const apiKeyEndpoint = defineApiEndpoint<OrganizationScopedEnv>(apiKeysPath)
 *
 * const listApiKeys = apiKeyEndpoint({
 *   route: createRoute({
 *     method: "get",
 *     path: "/",
 *     name: "listApiKeys",
 *     description: "List all API keys for the organization.",
 *     responses: { 200: jsonResponse(ListSchema, "OK") },
 *   }),
 *   handler: async (c) => c.json({ items: [] }, 200),
 * })
 *
 * export const createApiKeysRoutes = () => {
 *   const app = new OpenAPIHono<OrganizationScopedEnv>()
 *   for (const ep of [listApiKeys, ...]) ep.mountHttp(app)
 *   return app
 * }
 * ```
