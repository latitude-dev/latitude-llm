This is a response from an NPS survey:

Score: {{score}} 
Message: {{message}} 

Analyze the sentiment based on both the score and message. Prioritize identifying the primary concern in the feedback, 
focusing on the core issue mentioned by the user. Categorize the sentiment into one of the following categories:

- Product Features and Functionality
- User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)
- Performance and Reliability
- Customer Support and Service
- Onboarding and Learning Curve
- Pricing and Value Perception
- Integrations and Compatibility
- Scalability and Customization
- Feature Requests and Product Roadmap
- Competitor Comparison
- General Feedback (Neutral/Non-specific)

Return only one of the categories.
