## Integrations

We've added a new integrations section in the settings page. This section
allows you to connect your Latitude prompts to other tools and services such as
Figma, Notion, Slack, and more. We've started with 20+ integrations and we are
constantly adding more.

![](/assets/changelog/250317/integrations.png)

Under the hood, integrations are just MCP servers we automatically manage for
you, so you will see a deployment status and some deploy-related logs in the
integrations section. Most MCP servers take just a few seconds to deploy. We
also have a special integration type to connect your prompts to existing MCP
servers that you might be hosting yourself.

Integrations can easily be made available to your prompts via the integrations
section in the playground.

![](/assets/changelog/250317/integrations-2.png)

This feature is specially useful for agents that perform long running tasks and
need access to several tools and services. For example, here's an agent that
surfaces the web for some AI-related news and sends a summary to a Slack
channel.

[video](https://www.loom.com/share/9272a98a234b49e1bd32cfa28a93133d?sid=2ac3efb0-6e67-4190-841f-3f5f34330993)

The prompt is triggered everyday at 9AM, which brings us to the next topic...

## Triggers

We've added support for triggers in the playground. Triggers are a new way to
trigger your prompts based on certain heuristics. To start we've implemented 2 type of triggers:

- Time-based triggers: these triggers are triggered based on a specific time of day, for example, you can trigger your prompts at 9AM everyday.
- Email-based triggers: these triggers are triggered based on a specific email address, for example, you can trigger your prompts when a specific email address receives an email.

![](/assets/changelog/250317/triggers.png)

## Subagents

We've added support for subagents. Subagents are a way for agents to delegate tasks to other agents. This allows you to create complex agents that can handle more complex tasks.

![](/assets/changelog/250317/subagents.png)

## Other stuff

- Drag and drop files/folders from the sidebar
- Improved editor error reporting
- Improved agentic behavior of agents running in Latitude
- Added option to stop streaming from UI and Typescript SDK
- General performance and stability improvements

</Update>

<Update label='2025-02-20'>
## Built-in tools

We've added a set of built-in tools that are available in the playground.

- Web search: if enabled, the model will be able to search the web for information.
- Extract web content: great when paired with the web search tool, this will allow you to extract the content of a website.
- Run code: if your prompt requires some code execution, you can now activate this tool and the model will be able to generate and run code in a sandboxed environment.

We're working on adding more tools in the future, so if you have any suggestions, please let us know!

![](/assets/changelog/250220/tools.png)

## Playground improvements

Now you can see the results of your evaluations right there after running a prompt, and access the evaluation editor directly with that log already imported. This simplifies the workflow of iterating on both your prompts and your evaluations.

![](/assets/changelog/250220/evals.png)

Additionally, we added a new prompt configuration section that allows you to tweak values like temperature, set up limits, and activate our built-in tools very easily.

![](/assets/changelog/250220/config.png)

## Automatic refiner suggestions

We've added a new feature that suggests changes to your prompts based on the results of your evaluations, automatically. Now, whenever you run a prompt—from the playground or the API—that has an evaluation connected, you'll see suggestions appear next to the Refine button in the prompt editor. These suggestions are directly based on the evaluation results, so you can be sure they'll improve your prompt's quality.

![](/assets/changelog/250220/suggestions.png)

## Other stuff

- General improvements to stability and performance
- Updated list of available models
- Anthropic's cache configuration now works as expected
- New endpoint to fetch all available prompts for a project
- We added Vertex AI as a new provider

</Update>

<Update label='2025-01-22'>
## Agents

We're very happy to introduce the first version of Latitude Agents. An agent is a new way to build LLM-powered applications that can interact with the world and perform tasks.

The easiest way to think about agents is as a prompt that runs in a loop and has:

- Some instructions—including a goal and some context—just like any other prompt
- A set of tools that it can use to interact with the world
- A tool the agent can call to signal that it's finished its work

The agent runs in a loop, using the tools available to it to achieve its goal.

![](/assets/changelog/250122/agents.png)

This is the first step in our agent journey. We're already working on:

- Adding support for using other agents as tools
- Supporting code execution as a tool
- Building a library of built-in tools ready to use (web browsing, search, etc.)
- Agent tracing
- Triggers

We'll keep iterating on agents based on your feedback, so let us know what you think!

Read more about agents in our [docs](/guides/prompt-manager/agents).

## Full support for tool calling

We've added full support for tool calling in Latitude. You can now add tools to your prompts and test them directly on the playground.

Now, when a model calls a tool, the playground will prompt you to fill in the tool response so that the conversation can continue. You can either fill in the tool response manually or use our mock tool responses to test your prompts. These mock tool responses are AI-generated, so they are a great way to test your prompts without having to manually fill in the tool responses.

Running prompts with tool calls in batch mode is also supported, with mock tool responses for each tool call.

![](/assets/changelog/250122/tool-calls.png)

## Python SDK

We shipped the new Python SDK. Now you can interact with our API from your Python applications.

It ships with support for:

- Running prompts through our gateway
- Pushing logs to Latitude
- Telemetry, automatic tracing of your LLM calls

We're also working on adding support for compiling prompts locally, so you can run them from your code. Stay tuned!

Here's the documentation to get started with the [Python SDK](/guides/sdk/python).

## Other stuff

- General improvements to stability and performance
- Added revert/reset commit actions to the Project's History
- Added full support for OpenAI's `o1` model family
- The response of a step now is automatically parsed as JSON if the JSON output schema is defined.
- Lots of tool-related fixes

</Update>

<Update label='2024-12-18'>
## Latitude Telemetry

We've released the 1.0 version of Latitude's Typescript SDK, which ships with
support for [OpenLLMetry](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry). You can
now trace all your LLM generations with a couple lines of code and start using
Latitude's powerful prompt manager by creating prompts from your traces.

![](/assets/changelog/241218/telemetry-1.png)

Here's the full list of supported providers/sdks at launch:

- [Anthropic](/guides/sdk/tracing/anthropic)
- [AWS Bedrock](/guides/sdk/tracing/aws-bedrock)
- [Azure OpenAI](/guides/sdk/tracing/azure-openai)
- [Cohere](/guides/sdk/tracing/cohere)
- [Google AI Platform](/guides/sdk/tracing/google-ai-platform)
- [OpenAI](/guides/sdk/tracing/openai)
- [Vercel AI SDK](/guides/sdk/tracing/vercel-ai-sdk)
- [Vertex AI](/guides/sdk/tracing/vertex-ai)

And here's the documentation to get started with [Telemetry](/guides/sdk/typescript#tracing-your-llm-calls).

## Version history

We've added a new history section in projects. It displays the full history of prior committed versions of your project.

![](/assets/changelog/241218/history-1.png)

From a prompt, you can easily inspect its history by clicking on the history button at the top of the editor.

![](/assets/changelog/241218/history-2.png)

## File / Image prompt parameters

We've [introduced](/promptl/syntax/messages#content-types) support for "file" content-type in PromptL, unlocking OpenAI
input_audio audio files, Anthropic document PDF files and Google fileData
audio, video and document files.

And since Latitude uses PromptL, you can now upload files and images to prompts as prompt parameters.

![](/assets/changelog/241218/file-prompt-parameters.png)

Public prompts also support this feature, [btw](https://app.latitude.so/share/d/b8159c08-dddd-4f1d-9348-ede905a38089).

## Other stuff

- General improvements to stability and performance

</Update>

<Update label='2024-12-12'>
Welcome! A bit of a lighter update as we gear for a last big suprise before
christmas, next week. Here's this week's highlights:

## Create prompts from documents

Following up from the previous feature, we now allow you to create prompts
by simply uploading a document. This is a great way to quickly create prompts
from a document without having to write the prompt yourself.

![](/assets/changelog/241212/create-prompts-from-documents.png)

## Log Filters

We've added a new feature that allows you to filter your logs by a set of
commonly requested criteria.

![](/assets/changelog/241212/log-filters.png)

Keep an eye out for more filters to come!

## Other stuff

- We've increased our keep alive timeout setting to 10 minutes in order to
  match it with OpenAI's default setting. This helps when you are trying to
  generate a big JSON response. That being said, we always recommend using
  streaming responses when you expect a large response, as it effectively means
  you have limitless timeout.
- Updated some old documentation
- Released a new homepage!
- General improvements to stability and performance

![](/assets/changelog/241212/upload-documents.png)

</Update>

<Update label='2024-12-04'>
## Public prompts

We have released a new feature that allows you to share your prompts with the
world. Here's [an example](https://app.latitude.so/share/d/c899970f-a368-404f-ad10-3f55d3a7477f?chosen_topic=Elon) of a public prompt we've created.

To share your prompts, simply click the new share button in the prompt editor.

![](/assets/changelog/241204/public-prompts-1.png)

## Export logs

You can now select logs from the logs section and automatically create a
dataset from them or download them as a CSV file.

![](/assets/changelog/241204/export-logs-1.png)

This allows you to easily create golden datasets of parameters for your
prompts and use them to test new prompt iterations at scale.

## Collapsible parameters

We have updated the prompt preview in our prompt editor. Now parameter values
are automatically collapsed and can be expanded with a simple click.

![](/assets/changelog/241204/collapsible-parameters-1.png)

## Overview page

We have added a new project overview page that gives you a quick overview of
the project's overall cost, prompts, and evaluations.

![](/assets/changelog/241204/overview-1.png)

## Compile Latitude prompts locally

You can now compile Latitude prompts straight from your code using our SDK.
This allows you to still use Latitude's prompt editor, for iterating and
evaluating your prompts at scale, while maintaining your existing provider
integrations to run the prompts from your code. [docs](https://docs.latitude.so/guides/sdk/javascript-typescript-sdk#running-a-document-locally).

```typescript
const { config, messages } = await latitude.prompts.render({
  prompt,
  parameters: {
    // Any parameters your document expects
  },
})

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  ...config,
  messages,
})
```

## Other improvements

- Added tool calls to LLM-as-judge evaluations' context
- Fixed datasets containing JSON not working correctly in some scenarios
- General improvements in stability and performance

</Update>

<Update label='2024-11-26'>
## PromptL activated in Latitude

We have implemented the new version of our template syntax – PromptL – in
Latitude. As a reminder, PromptL is a new template syntax that has native
support for html/xml tags, contextless chain steps, as well as a slew of other
improvements that make it writing prompts in Latitude the best way to write
prompts. [docs](https://docs.latitude.so/promptl/getting-started/introduction)

![](/assets/changelog/241126/promptl-1.png)

## Refine prompt directly from evaluation logs

One of the most powerful features of Latitude is the ability to improve your
prompts based on results from evaluations – we call it Refiner. We have now made
this process easier by directly allowing users to choose evaluation results from
the evaluations page and trigger the refiner from there.

![](/assets/changelog/241126/refiner-1.png)

## Evaluation results in Logs

You can now see evaluation results in the logs section of your prompts. For each
log that has an evaluation result associated, the result will show up in the
details section of that log.

![](/assets/changelog/241126/logs-1.png)

## Other improvements

- You can now edit a version title and description before publishing it
- You can now rename projects
- Several improvements in stability and performance

![](/assets/changelog/241126/version-1.png)
![](/assets/changelog/241126/projects-1.png)

</Update>

<Update label='2024-11-20'>
  ## Human / Code evaluations

We have released a new type of evaluations: manual / code evaluations. This new
evaluation type allows users to evaluate their LLM outputs with human feedback or
code-based evaluations, and push the results to Latitude using our SDKs/API.

You can also submit results directly from Latitude's UI.

![](/assets/changelog/241120/hitl-evaluation-1.png)

[docs](https://docs.latitude.so/guides/sdk/javascript-typescript-sdk#pushing-evaluation-results-to-latitude)

## New prompt template syntax

We have open sourced the new version of our prompt templating syntax and we've
even given it a new name: [PromptL](https://promptl.ai/). This new syntax
introduces some highly requested features such as support for html/xml tags
without needing to escape them, chain steps with custom contexts, and more.

```mdx
<step as='researchPhase' provider='OpenAI' model='gpt-4'>
  <user>Research key points about {{ topic }} and create an outline.</user>
</step>

<step as='writing' isolated='true' temperature='0.7'>
    <user>
        Using this outline: {{ researchPhase.outline }}
        Write a detailed article.
    </user>
</step>
```

The new syntax will be enabled to all new prompts in Latitude by default starting Monday 25th
November. Since the new syntax is not compatible with the old one, existing
prompts will not get automatically upgraded to the new syntax and users will be
in charge of updating them.

## New parameters section for prompts

We have revamped our parameters section in prompts and introduced some highly
requested features. Users can now choose between inputing parameters manually,
from datasets, or from existing prompt logs. Moreover, any choice they make in
any of these sections gets automatically stored in session so that you don't
lose track of the latest inputs you chose if you ever navigate to another
section and later come back.

![](/assets/changelog/241120/parameters-1.png)
![](/assets/changelog/241120/parameters-2.png)
![](/assets/changelog/241120/parameters-3.png)

## Prompt analytics

We have added some key metrics to the logs section of your prompts. You can now
see at a glance the number of prompt runs, average latency and cost, and more.

![](/assets/changelog/241120/metrics-1.png)

## Default provider and models

We have added a new section in the settings page where you can set default
providers and models for your prompts. This allows you to quickly change the
default settings for your prompts without having to go through the prompt
creation flow every time.

![](/assets/changelog/241120/default-settings-1.png)
![](/assets/changelog/241120/default-settings-2.png)

## More improvements

- You can now get and create prompts from the SDK/API docs
- You can now eject from simple LLM-as-judge evaluations into more complete
  advanced evaluations that give you complete control over the evaluation prompt
- Updated UI code snippets on how to push logs and evaluations to Latitude
- Several improvements in infrastructure stability and performance
- Several improvements and fixes to UI/UX

</Update>

<Update label='2024-11-13'>
## New evaluations playground

We have completely revamped our evaluations to make it super simple to create
new evaluations from scratch. From now on you’ll only need to worry about typing
the goal of your evaluation—as well as any additional instructions that might be
useful.

![](/assets/changelog/241113/simple-evaluations-1.png)

## Latitude Cookbook

We’ve started work on Latitude’s Cookbook showcasing common use cases with
Latitude’s SDK. Here you can find the first examples.

## Anthropic cache

We have added support for Anthropic’s prompt caching beta feature.

## Rust SDK

Our community member @Dominik Spitzli has implemented a Rust port of Latitude’s SDK!

## Latitude Typescript SDK v1 released

We’ve released the first major version of Latitude’s SDK, v1.0.0, currently in
beta. It adds support for evaluations, pushing logs, JSON API, and more.

## Other improvements

- Dramatically improved performance of the prompt editor on large prompts
- Improved error reporting in the prompt editor
- Long-lived modals no longer close on click-outside or hitting ESC key
- Prompt input parameters are now stored in memory so that you can navigate to
  other sections and come back without losing the latest inputs you used in a
  specific prompt

</Update>

<Update label='2024-11-06'>
## Upload external logs

Users have long asked us to evaluate their prompts without having to run them
via Latitude’s Gateway. Well, we now support this use case. You can now upload
external logs to Latitude for evaluation so that, even if you run your prompts
outside of Latitude, you can keep tracking their performance. We support
uploading logs to Latitude both [from the
UI](https://docs.latitude.so/guides/logs/upload-logs#upload-logs) and our
[SDK/HTTP
API](https://docs.latitude.so/guides/sdk/javascript-typescript-sdk#pushing-a-log-to-latitude).

## Trigger evaluations from SDK

In cases where AI agents have long running conversations with users users only
want to evaluate the agent’s performance at particular points in time (i.e when
the conversation has finished). You can now trigger evaluations from our [SDK /
HTTP
API](https://docs.latitude.so/guides/sdk/javascript-typescript-sdk#evaluating-conversations),
giving you the tools to trigger evaluations at the precise moment you require
it.

## JSON API

We’ve released the [v2 version of our Gateway API](https://docs.latitude.so/guides/api/api-access#api-access), which supports non-streaming responses for the `run` and `chat` endpoints. We've also released the v1 major version of our SDK, which introduces support for the new HTTP API version, as well as the features above described.

## Other improvements

- Improved performance of prompt editor in large prompts
- Added code examples on how to use the SDK to the OSS repository
- Improved and fixed documentation in several places
- Several performance and stability improvements

</Update>
