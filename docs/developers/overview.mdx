Latitude Telemetry lets you connect your existing LLM-powered application to Latitude **in 5 minutes**, without changing how you call your model providers.

Once connected, every LLM execution becomes a **feature-scoped** log in Latitude that you can inspect, annotate, and evaluate — instead of dumping all traces into a single, unstructured bucket.

## Why use Latitude Telemetry?

With Telemetry you can:

- **Get feature-level observability**  
  Attach executions to specific prompts and versions instead of “one giant trace store”. Slice logs by feature, environment, user, or any metadata you send.

- **Understand real usage and performance**  
  See which prompts and models are actually used in production, along with latency, error rates, and input/output examples.

- **Annotate real executions**  
  Your team can label logs (e.g. “great answer”, “hallucination”, “formatting issue”), turning production traffic into a high-signal dataset.

- **Create custom evaluations for each feature**  
  Use LLM-as-judge, programmatic checks, or human-in-the-loop evaluations to continuously score outputs for each prompt or feature.

- **Automatically surface issues and bottlenecks**  
  Combine logs, annotations and evaluations to find broken prompts, regressions after a change, or slow/high-cost paths.

All of this works **on top of your existing stack** — you keep calling OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, etc. directly, and Telemetry observes those calls.

## How Telemetry fits into your stack (high level)

At a high level, integrating Telemetry looks like this:

1. **Install the Telemetry package** in your app.
2. **Wrap each feature or prompt execution** so Latitude can tie logs back to a specific prompt and version.
3. **See your logs in Latitude** and annotate them with your own metadata.

## Next steps

1. Choose the provider/framework your application already uses (or OpenTelemetry OTLP ingest).
2. Open its integration page.
3. Follow the step-by-step guide to install and initialize Latitude Telemetry for that stack.
