title: Groq
description: Connect your Groq-powered application to Latitude Telemetry for feature-level observability and evaluations.
---

<Note>
  This integration is only available in the **Python SDK**.
</Note>

## Overview

This guide shows you how to integrate **Latitude Telemetry** into an existing application that uses the official **Groq SDK**.

After completing these steps:

- Every Groq call (e.g. `chat.completions.create`) can be captured as a log in Latitude.
- Logs are grouped under a **prompt**, identified by a `path`, inside a Latitude **project**.
- You can inspect inputs/outputs, measure latency, and debug Groq-powered features from the Latitude dashboard.

<Check>
  You'll keep calling Groq exactly as you do today — Telemetry simply observes
  and enriches those calls.
</Check>

## Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A **Latitude account** and **API key**
- A **Latitude project ID**
- A Python-based project that uses the **Groq SDK**

That's it — prompts do **not** need to be created ahead of time.

---

## Steps

<Steps>

  <Step title="Install requirements">
    Add the Latitude Telemetry package to your project:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash pip
      pip install latitude-telemetry
      ```

      ```bash uv
      uv add latitude-telemetry
      ```

      ```bash poetry
      poetry add latitude-telemetry
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Wrap your Groq-powered feature">
    Initialize Latitude Telemetry and wrap the code that calls Groq using <code>telemetry.capture</code>.

    You can use the `capture` method as a decorator (recommended) or as a context manager:

    ```python Using decorator (recommended)
    import os
    from groq import Groq
    from latitude_telemetry import Telemetry, Instrumentors, TelemetryOptions

    telemetry = Telemetry(
        os.environ["LATITUDE_API_KEY"],
        TelemetryOptions(instrumentors=[Instrumentors.Groq]),
    )

    @telemetry.capture(
        project_id=123,  # The ID of your project in Latitude
        path="generate-support-reply",  # Add a path to identify this prompt in Latitude
    )
    def generate_support_reply(input: str) -> str:
        client = Groq()
        completion = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": input}],
        )
        return completion.choices[0].message.content
    ```

    ```python Using context manager
    import os
    from groq import Groq
    from latitude_telemetry import Telemetry, Instrumentors, TelemetryOptions

    telemetry = Telemetry(
        os.environ["LATITUDE_API_KEY"],
        TelemetryOptions(instrumentors=[Instrumentors.Groq]),
    )

    def generate_support_reply(input: str) -> str:
        with telemetry.capture(
            project_id=123,  # The ID of your project in Latitude
            path="generate-support-reply",  # Add a path to identify this prompt in Latitude
        ):
            client = Groq()
            completion = client.chat.completions.create(
                model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": input}],
            )
            return completion.choices[0].message.content
    ```

    <Info>
    The `path`:
    - Identifies the prompt in Latitude
    - Can be new or existing
    - Should not contain spaces or special characters (use letters, numbers, `- _ / .`)
    </Info>

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Streaming responses

When using streaming (`stream=True`), use a generator function with the decorator. The SDK keeps the span open until all chunks are yielded:

```python
@telemetry.capture(project_id=123, path="generate-support-reply")
async def stream_support_reply(input: str):
    client = Groq()
    stream = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": input}],
        stream=True,
    )
    for chunk in stream:
        if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
            yield chunk.choices[0].delta.content
```

---

## Seeing your logs in Latitude

Once your feature is wrapped, logs will appear automatically.

1. Open the **prompt** in your Latitude dashboard (identified by `path`)
2. Go to the **Traces** section
3. Each execution will show:
   - Input and output messages
   - Model and token usage
   - Latency and errors
   - One trace per feature invocation

Each Groq call appears as a child span under the captured prompt execution, giving you a full, end-to-end view of what happened.

---

## That's it

No changes to your Groq calls, no special return values, and no extra plumbing — just wrap the feature you want to observe.
