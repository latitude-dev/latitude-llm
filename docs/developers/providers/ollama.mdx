title: Ollama
description: Connect your Ollama-powered application to Latitude Telemetry for feature-level observability and evaluations.
---

<Note>
  This integration is only available in the **Python SDK**.
</Note>

## Overview

This guide shows you how to integrate **Latitude Telemetry** into an existing application that uses the official **Ollama SDK**.

After completing these steps:

- Every Ollama call (e.g. `chat`, `generate`) can be captured as a log in Latitude.
- Logs are grouped under a **prompt**, identified by a `path`, inside a Latitude **project**.
- You can inspect inputs/outputs, measure latency, and debug Ollama-powered features from the Latitude dashboard.

<Check>
  You'll keep calling Ollama exactly as you do today — Telemetry simply observes
  and enriches those calls.
</Check>

## Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A **Latitude account** and **API key**
- A **Latitude project ID**
- A Python-based project that uses the **Ollama SDK**
- A running Ollama instance (local or remote)

That's it — prompts do **not** need to be created ahead of time.

---

## Steps

<Steps>

  <Step title="Install requirements">
    Add the Latitude Telemetry package to your project:

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash pip
      pip install latitude-telemetry
      ```

      ```bash uv
      uv add latitude-telemetry
      ```

      ```bash poetry
      poetry add latitude-telemetry
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize Latitude Telemetry">
    Create a single Telemetry instance when your app starts.

    You must enable the **Ollama** instrumentor so Telemetry can trace it.

    ```python telemetry.py
    import os
    from latitude_telemetry import Telemetry, Instrumentors, TelemetryOptions

    telemetry = Telemetry(
        os.environ["LATITUDE_API_KEY"],
        TelemetryOptions(
            instrumentors=[Instrumentors.Ollama],  # This enables automatic tracing for the Ollama SDK
        ),
    )
    ```

    <Info>
      The Telemetry instance should only be created once. Any Ollama client
      instantiated after this will be automatically traced.
    </Info>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Wrap your Ollama-powered feature">
    Wrap the code that calls Ollama using <code>telemetry.capture</code>.

    You can use the `capture` method as a decorator (recommended) or as a context manager:

    ```python Using decorator (recommended)
    import ollama
    from telemetry import telemetry

    @telemetry.capture(
        project_id=123,  # The ID of your project in Latitude
        path="generate-support-reply",  # Add a path to identify this prompt in Latitude
    )
    def generate_support_reply(input: str) -> str:
        # Your regular LLM-powered feature code here
        response = ollama.chat(
            model="llama3.2",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": input}],
        )

        # You can return anything you want — the value is passed through unchanged
        return response["message"]["content"]
    ```

    ```python Using context manager
    import ollama
    from telemetry import telemetry

    def generate_support_reply(input: str) -> str:
        with telemetry.capture(
            project_id=123,  # The ID of your project in Latitude
            path="generate-support-reply",  # Add a path to identify this prompt in Latitude
        ):
            # Your regular LLM-powered feature code here
            response = ollama.chat(
                model="llama3.2",
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": input}],
            )

            # You can return anything you want — the value is passed through unchanged
            return response["message"]["content"]
    ```

    <Info>
    The `path`:
    - Identifies the prompt in Latitude
    - Can be new or existing
    - Should not contain spaces or special characters (use letters, numbers, `- _ / .`)
    </Info>

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Seeing your logs in Latitude

Once your feature is wrapped, logs will appear automatically.

1. Open the **prompt** in your Latitude dashboard (identified by `path`)
2. Go to the **Traces** section
3. Each execution will show:
   - Input and output messages
   - Model and token usage
   - Latency and errors
   - One trace per feature invocation

Each Ollama call appears as a child span under the captured prompt execution, giving you a full, end-to-end view of what happened.

---

## That's it

No changes to your Ollama calls, no special return values, and no extra plumbing — just wrap the feature you want to observe.
