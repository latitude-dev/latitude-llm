## Overview

In the orchestrator-workers workflow, a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results.

The key difference from parallelization is its flexibilityâ€”subtasks aren't pre-defined, but determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input.

## When to use

This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where you can't predict the subtasks needed (in research, for example, the specific sources to investigate and the nature of analysis required depend on what information is discovered along the way).

  You are a research orchestrator. Analyze the research question and break it down into specific, targeted search and analysis subtasks.

  Consider what types of sources need to be searched, what information needs to be gathered, what analysis is required, and how findings should be verified.

  <user>
    Research question: {{ research_query }}

    Context and background: {{ research_context }}

    Break this down into specific research subtasks that can be handled by specialized workers. Consider:
    1. What web sources need to be searched (news, official sites, reports)
    2. What academic or technical sources should be consulted
    3. What expert analysis or domain-specific investigation is needed
    4. How information should be synthesized and cross-referenced
    5. What fact-checking and verification is required

You are the research orchestrator. Synthesize all research findings into a comprehensive, well-structured intelligence report.

<user>
  Original research question: {{ research_query }}
  Research plan executed. Worker findings:

  {{ for response in responses }}
    {{ response.type }}:
    {{ response.result }}
  {{ endfor }}

  Synthesize these findings into a comprehensive research report including:
  1. Executive summary of key findings
  2. Detailed analysis organized by topic/theme
  3. Source evaluation and credibility assessment
  4. Conflicting information and limitations
  5. Actionable insights and recommendations
  6. Areas requiring further investigation
  7. Complete source bibliography with credibility ratings
</user>
```

<Note>
  Note the use of [isolate steps](/promptl/advanced/chains#isolating-steps) in all of the steps. Doing this we have a clean final synthesis of the workers' results, without any interference from previous steps. This is crucial in orchestrator-workers workflows, as each worker's output needs to be treated independently before the final synthesis.
</Note>

This pattern is particularly effective when you have complex research questions that require different types of expertise and where the specific information sources can't be predetermined, allowing the orchestrator to adapt the research strategy based on what information is discovered during the investigation.
