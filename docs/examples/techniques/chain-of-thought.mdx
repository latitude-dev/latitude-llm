## What is Chain-of-Thought?

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting guides AI models to break down complex problems into step-by-step reasoning processes. Instead of jumping directly to an answer, the AI explains its thinking process, leading to more accurate and explainable results.

## Why Use Chain-of-Thought?

- **Improved Accuracy**: Step-by-step reasoning reduces errors on complex problems
- **Explainable AI**: Users can follow the reasoning process
- **Better Problem Solving**: Handles multi-step mathematical and logical problems
- **Debugging**: Easy to identify where reasoning went wrong
- **Complex Analysis**: Breaks down complicated scenarios into manageable parts

## Basic Implementation

# Mathematical Problem Solving

Solve this step by step, showing your reasoning at each stage.

Problem: {{ math_problem }}

Let me think through this step by step:

Step 1: Identify what we know
- [List the given information]

Step 2: Identify what we need to find
- [State the objective clearly]

Step 3: Choose the appropriate method
- [Explain which approach to use and why]

Step 4: Execute the solution
- [Show the calculations step by step]

Step 5: Verify the answer
- [Check if the result makes sense]

Final Answer: [State the final result clearly]
```

## Advanced CoT with Latitude Chains

LLM perform better when they can reason through complex problems step by step. In the case of Latitude `<step>` blocks what they do is to call the AI only with the content inside the `<step>` block, so the AI can focus on that specific part of the reasoning process. This allows for more structured and manageable reasoning.

<Note>
  Doing this way is more expensive than a single prompt, but it allows for more complex reasoning and better results. Is more expensive because it does N calls to the AI, where N is the number of `<step>` blocks. And the amount of context of the steps is accumulated, so the AI can use all the context of the previous steps.
