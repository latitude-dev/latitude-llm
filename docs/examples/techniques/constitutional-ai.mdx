## What is Constitutional AI?

Constitutional AI (CAI) is a prompting technique that guides AI behavior through explicit principles or rules that serve as "constitutional" guidelines. The AI is instructed to evaluate and improve its own outputs against these principles, promoting ethical, safe, and aligned responses without requiring human feedback for each interaction.

## Why Use Constitutional AI?

- **Ethical Alignment**: Ensures AI responses adhere to defined ethical standards
- **Safety Improvement**: Reduces harmful, biased, or misleading outputs
- **Self-Correction**: Enables the model to critique and revise its own responses
- **Reduced Oversight**: Lessens the need for constant human review
- **Customizable Values**: Allows tailoring principles to specific use cases or organizational values

## Basic Implementation in Latitude

Here's a simple constitutional AI example for general conversation:

```markdown Basic Constitutional AI
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4.1
temperature: 0.5
---

# Constitutional AI Assistant

You are an assistant that follows a clear set of principles. Before answering, check if your response aligns with these constitutional principles:

## Constitutional Principles:
1. Provide accurate and truthful information.
2. Respect user privacy and confidentiality.
3. Refuse to engage with harmful, illegal, or unethical requests.
4. Maintain impartiality on divisive political or social issues.
5. Be transparent about limitations and uncertainties.

## User Request:
{{ user_query }}

## Response Process:
1. **First Draft**: Create an initial response to the user query.
2. **Constitutional Review**: Evaluate the draft against the principles above.
3. **Final Response**: Revise if needed, then provide your answer.
```

## Advanced Implementation with Self-Critique

Let's create a more sophisticated example that uses Latitude's chain feature to implement a formal self-critique and revision process:

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Advanced Constitutional AI
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4.1
temperature: 0.5
---

<step>
# Initial Response Generation

  You are a helpful AI assistant responding to the following user request:

  {{ user_request }}

  Based on your knowledge and capabilities, provide a comprehensive initial response below:

  ## Initial Response:
</step>

<step>
  # Constitutional Review

  Review your initial response:

  Evaluate this response against the following constitutional principles:

  ## Constitutional Principles:
  1. **Accuracy**: Information should be factual and up-to-date.
  2. **Fairness**: Responses should be balanced and avoid bias.
  3. **Safety**: No harmful content should be provided.
  4. **Privacy**: User privacy should be respected.
  5. **Transparency**: Limitations and uncertainties should be acknowledged.

  ## Critique:
  For each principle that may be violated, provide:
  1. The principle of concern
  2. The specific issue in the response
  3. A suggestion for improvement

  If the response fully adheres to all principles, state that.
</step>

# Final Response

Based on the initial response and critique:

Now, generate an improved final response that addresses any issues identified in the critique. If no issues were found, you may provide the initial response with any minor enhancements.

## Final Response to User:
```
</CodeGroup>

In this advanced example:

1. **Multi-Step Process**: We separate response generation, critique, and revision
2. **Explicit Principles**: Clear constitutional guidelines to evaluate against
3. **Structured Review**: A formal process for identifying issues
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Refinement based on self-critique

## Domain-Specific Constitutional AI

Create custom constitutional principles for specific domains:

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Medical Information Constitutional AI
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.4
---

<step>
# Medical Information Assistant

You are a medical information assistant helping with the following query:

{{ medical_query }}

Provide an informative response based on current medical knowledge.

## Initial Response:
</step>

<step>
# Medical Constitution Review

You are a medical ethics reviewer. Review this response to a medical query:

## Medical Constitutional Principles:
1. **Evidence-Based**: Only provide information supported by current medical research.
2. **Scope of Practice**: Clearly state that you are not providing medical advice or diagnosis.
3. **Emergency Guidance**: For urgent medical concerns, advise seeking immediate professional care.
4. **Privacy**: Do not encourage sharing personally identifiable health information.
5. **Comprehensiveness**: Present relevant risks, benefits, and alternatives.
6. **Accessibility**: Use clear language understandable to non-specialists.

## Constitutional Violations:
Identify any violations of the above principles in the response, explaining specifically what was violated and why.

## Improvement Suggestions:
Provide concrete suggestions to fix any violations.
</step>

<step>
# Final Medical Response

Based on the initial response and constitutional review:
Create a revised response that addresses all identified constitutional concerns while providing helpful, accurate medical information.

## Final Response:
</step>
```
</CodeGroup>

## Multi-Stage Constitutional Review

For critical applications, implement multi-layered constitutional checks:

</step>

<step>
# Final Constitutional Revision

You are creating final content that addresses all constitutional concerns.

Original draft:
{{ initial_draft }}

Safety review:
{{ safety_check }}

Accuracy review:
{{ accuracy_check }}

Create a final version that addresses all identified concerns while preserving the helpful intent of the original response.

## Final Content:
</step>
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>Subtle detail. Notice the use of `as` attribute in the `<step>` tags. This allow to create [isolated steps](/promptl/advanced/chains#isolating-steps) that prevent a step to inherit previous context. So each step analyze `initial_draft` independently, allowing for a clean separation of concerns.</Note>

## Advanced Techniques

### Dynamic Constitutional Selection

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Dynamic Constitution
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4.1
temperature: 0.3
---
<step as="context_analysis" schema={{{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "category": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": [
        "business_ethics",
        "creative_content",
        "factual_information",
        "sensitive_topics"
      ]
    }
  },
  "required": ["category"]
}}}>
# Query Context Analysis

Analyze the following user query:

{{ user_query }}

Determine which of the following constitutional sets would be most relevant:
- business_ethics (for business and workplace questions)
- creative_content (for creative writing and generation)
- factual_information (for educational and factual queries)
- sensitive_topics (for political, social, or controversial topics)

## Selected Constitution:
</step>

<step>
{{ category = context_analysis.category }}

{{ if category === "business_ethics" }}
  <prompt path="templates/business_ethics" query="{{ user_query }}" />
{{ else if category === "sensitive_topics" }}
  <prompt path="templates/sensitive_topics" query="{{ user_query }}" />
{{ else if category === "factual_information" }}
  <prompt path="templates/factual_information" query="{{ user_query }}" />
{{ else }}
  <prompt path="templates/creative_content" query="{{ user_query }}" />
{{ endif }}
</step>
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>Note how we used [structured outputs](/guides/prompt-manager/json-output) to analyze the query context and dynamically select the appropriate constitutional principles based on the category of the query. This allows for more tailored responses while maintaining constitutional integrity.</Note>

### Constitutional Governance with Hierarchy

Implement organizational values with weighted principles:

<step>
# Hierarchical Constitutional Review

Review this response according to our hierarchical principles:

{{ response }}

## Primary Constitutional Principles (Must Never Violate):
1. Patient safety and wellbeing above all other considerations
2. Medical accuracy and evidence-based information
3. Patient privacy and HIPAA compliance
4. Medical ethics and professional standards

## Secondary Constitutional Principles (Should Follow):
1. Organizational values and brand voice
2. Accessibility and inclusive language
3. Cultural sensitivity and respect
4. Supportive and empathetic tone

## Tertiary Constitutional Principles (When Possible):
1. Educational value
2. Actionable recommendations
3. Resource efficiency
4. Positive framing

For each level of principles, evaluate compliance and suggest revisions as needed. Primary principles must be satisfied before considering secondary or tertiary principles.

## Revised Response:

```
</CodeGroup>

## Integration with Other Techniques

Constitutional AI works well combined with other prompting techniques:

- **Role Prompting + Constitutional AI**: Assign expert roles with ethical guidelines
- **Chain-of-Thought + Constitutional AI**: Apply principles to reasoning steps
- **Few-Shot Learning + Constitutional AI**: Provide examples of principle application
- **Self-Consistency + Constitutional AI**: Generate multiple responses and select the most constitutionally aligned

The key is embedding the constitutional principles at the right stage of your prompt workflow to ensure alignment without overly constraining helpful responses.
