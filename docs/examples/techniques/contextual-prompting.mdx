## What is Contextual Prompting?

Contextual prompting is a technique that provides AI models with relevant background information, context, and specific details about the task at hand. By supplying this context within your prompts, you enable the AI to better understand your request and generate more accurate, relevant, and useful responses.

Unlike simple, isolated prompts, contextual prompting gives the model the necessary information to understand the situation, requirements, and desired outcome, leading to significantly improved results.

## Why Use Contextual Prompting?

By providing contextual prompts, you can help ensure that your AI interactions are as seamless and efficient as possible. The model will be able to more quickly understand your request and generate more accurate and relevant responses.

Key benefits include:

- **Improved Accuracy**: Models can better understand the specific requirements and constraints
- **Faster Understanding**: Reduces the need for back-and-forth clarification
- **More Relevant Output**: Results are tailored to your specific use case and context
- **Reduced Ambiguity**: Clear context eliminates guesswork and misinterpretation
- **Enhanced Efficiency**: Fewer iterations needed to achieve the desired outcome

## Contextual Prompting in Latitude

Here's a simple example showing how to provide context for a blog content generation task:

```markdown Blog Content Generator
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.7
---

# Blog Content Generator with Context

You are writing for a blog about retro 80's arcade video games.

## Context:
- Target audience: Gaming enthusiasts and nostalgia seekers
- Tone: Informative yet engaging, with a touch of nostalgia
- Focus: Historical significance, cultural impact, and technical innovation
- Format: Well-structured articles with clear sections

## Task:
{{ task_description }}

## Additional Context:
{{ additional_context || "No additional context provided." }}

## Output:
Generate content that incorporates the provided context and meets the specific requirements:
```
## Demonstrating the Power of Context: Blog Article Example

**Without Context:**
```markdown Simple Blog Prompt
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 1
---

Suggest 3 topics to write an article about with a few lines of description of what this article should contain.
```

**With Context:**
```markdown Contextual Blog Prompt
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 1
---

Context: You are writing for a blog about retro 80's arcade video games.

Suggest 3 topics to write an article about with a few lines of description of what this article should contain.
```

The contextual version produces more targeted, relevant suggestions like:
- **The Evolution of Arcade Cabinet Design** - Exploring how cabinet designs evolved from early wood and metal cabinets to sleek, neon-lit designs
- **Blast From The Past: Iconic Arcade Games of The 80's** - Featuring iconic games, their innovations, and enduring charm
- **The Rise and Retro Revival of Pixel Art** - Tracing pixel art evolution and its resurgence in modern games

## Context Categories for Better Prompting

Organize your context into these key categories for maximum effectiveness:

### 1. Domain Context
Provide relevant background information about the subject matter, industry, or field.

### 2. Audience Context
Specify who the output is intended for, their knowledge level, and preferences.

### 3. Task Context
Clearly define the specific requirements, constraints, and expected deliverables.

### 4. Tone and Style Context
Describe the desired communication style, formality level, and voice.

### 5. Format Context
Specify the expected structure, length, and presentation format.
