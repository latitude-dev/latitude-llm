## What is Emotional Intelligence Prompting?

Emotional intelligence prompting is a technique that enhances AI responses by incorporating principles of emotional awareness, empathy, and social understanding. It guides AI systems to recognize, interpret, and appropriately respond to emotional cues, social dynamics, and interpersonal contexts. This approach helps AI generate responses that are not only factually accurate but also emotionally attuned, socially appropriate, and sensitive to the nuanced human experiences underlying user queries.

## Why Use Emotional Intelligence Prompting?

- **Enhanced Empathy**: Creates responses that acknowledge and validate user emotions
- **Social Appropriateness**: Ensures AI responses match social context and norms
- **Relationship Building**: Helps establish rapport and trust with users
- **Conflict Sensitivity**: Navigates delicate or emotionally charged situations
- **Emotional Support**: Provides more comforting and helpful responses for emotional needs
- **Improved Communication**: Adjusts tone and approach based on emotional context
- **Cultural Awareness**: Considers cultural differences in emotional expression and interpretation

## Basic Implementation in Latitude

Here's a simple emotional intelligence prompting example for supportive responses:

```markdown Emotionally Aware Response

# Emotionally Intelligent Response Generation

Respond to the following input with emotional intelligence and empathy.

## User Input:
{{ user_input }}

## Emotional Intelligence Process:

### 1. Emotion Recognition
First, identify the emotions potentially present in this input:
- Primary emotions likely being expressed
- Emotional intensity level (low, moderate, high)
- Any mixed or conflicting emotions

### 2. Empathetic Understanding
Consider what might be behind these emotions:
- Potential needs or concerns underlying the emotions
- Possible context or experiences that could explain the emotional state
- What validation or acknowledgment might be appropriate

### 3. Response Planning
Plan a response that demonstrates emotional intelligence:
- Acknowledge identified emotions appropriately
- Adjust tone to match the emotional context
- Balance emotional support with practical assistance
- Consider the impact your response might have

## Emotionally Intelligent Response:
Based on the analysis above, here is my emotionally intelligent response:

<step>
# Emotional Context Analysis

Let's analyze the emotional dimensions of this interaction:

## User Input:
{{ user_input }}

## Emotional Perception:
1. **Expressed Emotions**: What emotions are explicitly expressed?
2. **Implied Emotions**: What emotions might be present but not directly stated?
3. **Emotional Intensity**: How strong are these emotions?
4. **Emotional Complexity**: Are there multiple or mixed emotions?

## Situational Context:
1. **User Circumstances**: What situation might the user be in?
2. **Stakes and Importance**: How significant is this matter to the user?
3. **Timing Factors**: Is this urgent, ongoing, or reflective?
4. **Social Context**: What relationships or social dynamics might be involved?

## User Needs Assessment:
1. **Primary Need**: Is the user primarily seeking:
   - Emotional support and validation
   - Practical information or solutions
   - Guidance for decision-making
   - Understanding of a complex situation
   - A combination of these needs

2. **Support Type Needed**:
   - Validation and empathy
   - Reassurance and encouragement
   - Clarity and information
   - Guidance and direction
   - Space for expression
</step>

<step>
# Response Strategy Development

Based on the emotional analysis, let's develop an emotionally intelligent response strategy:

## Emotional Attunement Approach:
1. **Recognition Strategy**: How to acknowledge the identified emotions
2. **Validation Approach**: How to validate the user's experience
3. **Empathy Expression**: How to demonstrate understanding
4. **Tone Calibration**: What tone will best match the emotional context
   - Warmth level: [low/moderate/high]
   - Formality level: [casual/balanced/formal]
   - Energy level: [calm/moderate/energetic]

## Communication Framework:
1. **Opening**: How to establish emotional connection
2. **Structure**: How to organize information for emotional impact
3. **Language Choice**: What types of words and phrases to use or avoid
4. **Balance**: How to balance emotional support with other content
</step>

<step>
# Emotionally Intelligent Response Generation

Now I'll craft a response using the emotional intelligence framework:

## Response Components:
1. **Emotional Acknowledgment**:
   [Acknowledge identified emotions with specific language]

2. **Empathetic Connection**:
   [Create connection based on understanding their situation]

3. **Supportive Content**:
   [Provide information, advice, or guidance in an emotionally attuned way]

4. **Empowerment Element**:
   [Include elements that respect autonomy and support self-efficacy]

5. **Compassionate Closure**:
   [End with emotionally appropriate closing]

## Complete Response:
[Full response integrating all emotional intelligence elements]
</step>

<step>
# Emotional Impact Assessment

Let me evaluate the emotional intelligence of my response:

## Emotional Intelligence Evaluation:
1. **Emotion Recognition Accuracy**: How accurately did I identify emotions?
2. **Empathy Effectiveness**: How well did I demonstrate genuine understanding?
3. **Validation Quality**: How effectively did I validate the user's experience?
4. **Tone Appropriateness**: How well did my tone match the emotional context?
5. **Support Effectiveness**: How well did I address both emotional and practical needs?
6. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Did I consider cultural aspects of emotional expression?

## Potential Improvements:
[Identify any aspects that could be enhanced for better emotional intelligence]

## Refined Response:
[Adjusted response with improvements to emotional intelligence elements]
</step>
```
</CodeGroup>

In this advanced example:

1. **Comprehensive Analysis**: The first step focuses on understanding the emotional context
2. **Strategic Planning**: The second step develops a tailored emotional response strategy
3. **Structured Response**: The third step implements the strategy in a complete response
4. **Self-Assessment**: The final step evaluates and refines the emotional intelligence
