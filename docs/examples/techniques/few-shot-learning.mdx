## What is Few-shot Learning?

Few-shot learning is a prompting technique where you provide the AI with a small number of examples (typically 2-10) to demonstrate the desired pattern, format, or behavior before asking it to perform a similar task. This technique leverages the AI's ability to recognize patterns and generalize from limited examples.

## Why Use Few-shot Learning?

- **Improved Accuracy**: Examples help the AI understand exactly what you want
- **Consistent Format**: Ensures outputs follow a specific structure
- **Reduced Ambiguity**: Clear examples eliminate guesswork
- **Better Context Understanding**: Shows the AI how to handle edge cases
- **Domain Adaptation**: Helps AI adapt to specific domains or styles

## Basic Implementation in Latitude

Here's a simple few-shot learning example for email classification:

```markdown Email Classification
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.1
---

# Email Classification Task

You are an expert email classifier. Based on the examples below, classify the given email
into one of these categories: URGENT, SPAM, BUSINESS, PERSONAL.

## Examples:

**Email**: "CONGRATULATIONS! You've won $1,000,000! Click here now!"
**Category**: SPAM

**Email**: "Hi John, can we reschedule tomorrow's meeting? I have a family emergency."
**Category**: PERSONAL

**Email**: "SYSTEM ALERT: Server down. Immediate attention required. Revenue impact critical."
**Category**: URGENT

**Email**: "Please find attached the Q4 financial report for your review."
**Category**: BUSINESS

## Email to Classify:
{{ email_content }}

## Category:
```

## Advanced Implementation with Variables

Let's create a more sophisticated example that uses [Latitude's parameters system](/guides/prompt-manager/playground#parameter-types):

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Advanced Few-shot

provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.2

# {{ product_category }} Product Review Sentiment Analysis

Analyze the sentiment of {{ product_category }} reviews and extract {{ detail_level }} insights. Use the examples below as a guide.

## Examples:

{{ for example in examples }}
**Review**: "{{ example.text }}"
**Sentiment**: {{ example.sentiment }}
**Key Points**: {{ example.key_points }}
**Confidence**: {{ example.confidence }}
{{ endfor }}

## Review to Analyze:
{{ review_text }}

## Analysis:
**Sentiment**:
**Key Points**:
**Confidence**:
```
</CodeGroup>

In this advanced example:

1. **Dynamic Content**: We use templates (`{{ variable }}`) to insert parameters into the prompt.

3. **Templating Features**: We demonstrate control structures like `{{for item in items }}` for arrays.

4. **Runtime Examples**: The `examples` array parameter allows users to pass in any number of examples when calling the prompt.

This pattern makes your prompts more flexible and reusable across different use cases without creating separate prompts for each scenario. For more on parameters, see the [Latitude Parameter Types documentation](/guides/prompt-manager/playground#parameter-types).

## Multi-step Few-shot with Chains

**Input**: "Looking for $2M Series A for our AI-powered healthcare platform serving hospitals nationwide."
```json
{
  "business_type": "AI platform",
  "industry": "healthcare",
  "location": "nationwide",
  "funding_needed": "$2M"
}
```

## Proposal to Extract:
{{ proposal_text }}

## Extracted Information:

<step>
# Business Viability Analysis

Based on the extracted information, provide a viability score following these examples:

## Examples:

**Business**: AI healthcare platform, $2M Series A, nationwide
**Viability Score**: 8.5/10
**Reasoning**: Large addressable market, proven demand, appropriate funding level

**Business**: Food delivery app, $50K seed, NYC only
**Viability Score**: 6.0/10

## Advanced Techniques

### Self-Improving Few-shot

Create prompts that can improve their own examples:

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Self-Improving
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.4
---

<step>
# Process the task with current examples

Current examples:
{{ current_examples }}

Task: {{ user_task }}

Result:
</step>

<step>
# Evaluate the result quality

Result: {{ initial_processing }}

Was this result satisfactory? If not, what examples would improve future performance?

Evaluation:
</step>

<step>
# Generate improved examples if needed

Based on the evaluation. If needs improvement. Generate 2-3 new examples that would help with tasks like: {{ user_task }}
New examples should address the identified weaknesses.

Improved Examples:
</step>
```
</CodeGroup>

### Cross-Domain Transfer

Use few-shot learning to transfer patterns across domains:

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Cross-Domain Transfer
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.3
---

# Cross-Domain Pattern Transfer

Learn the pattern from {{ source_domain }} examples and apply it to {{ target_domain }}.

## Source Domain Examples ({{ source_domain }}):

{{ for example in source_examples }}
**Input**: {{ example.input }}
**Pattern Applied**: {{ example.pattern }}
**Output**: {{ example.output }}
{{ endfor }}

## Pattern Recognition:
The consistent pattern across these examples is: {{ identified_pattern }}

## Target Domain Application ({{ target_domain }}):
Now apply the same pattern to this {{ target_domain }} scenario:

**Input**: {{ target_input }}
**Pattern to Apply**: {{ identified_pattern }}
**Output**:
```
</CodeGroup>

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

<Warning>
**Avoid These Common Mistakes**:
- **Too Many Examples**: More isn't always better; 3-7 examples are usually optimal
- **Inconsistent Formatting**: Make sure all examples follow the same structure
- **Biased Examples**: Include diverse scenarios to avoid model bias
- **Unclear Boundaries**: Clearly separate examples from the actual task
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Pro Tips**:
- Start with 2-3 examples and add more if needed
- Test your few-shot prompts with edge cases
- Use Latitude's version control to iterate on example sets
- Combine with other techniques like Chain-of-Thought for complex reasoning
