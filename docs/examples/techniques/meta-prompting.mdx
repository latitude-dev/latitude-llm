## What is Meta Prompting?

Meta prompting is a technique where an AI system itself creates, evaluates, or refines prompts that are then used to accomplish tasks. Instead of relying solely on human-designed prompts, meta prompting leverages AI's capabilities to generate optimized instructions that can better guide subsequent AI responses. This approach involves "prompting about prompting," creating a recursive framework that can lead to improved performance.

## Why Use Meta Prompting?

- **Prompt Optimization**: Automatically generates more effective prompts than manual creation
- **Task Adaptation**: Tailors prompts to specific tasks or domains without human expertise
- **Quality Improvement**: Refines outputs through iterative prompt enhancement
- **Error Reduction**: Identifies and fixes issues in prompts that lead to poor responses
- **Efficiency**: Saves time by automating the prompt engineering process

## Basic Implementation in Latitude

Here's a simple meta prompting example for content creation:

```markdown Basic Meta Prompting
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.7
---

# Meta Prompt Generator

## Task Description
I need to generate content about: {{ topic }}
For audience: {{ audience }}
In tone: {{ tone }}
Content type: {{ content_type }}
Length: {{ length }} words

## Meta Prompt Process
1. Analyze the task requirements and target audience
2. Create an optimized prompt that would generate the best possible content for this specific task
3. Provide the optimized prompt in a clear, structured format

## Generated Prompt:
Generate a prompt that would help an AI create the best possible {{ content_type }} about {{ topic }} for {{ audience }}. The prompt should:

- Guide the AI to use a {{ tone }} tone
- Structure the content appropriately for a {{ content_type }}
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of important aspects of {{ topic }}
- Target the content specifically to {{ audience }} needs and knowledge level
- Result in approximately {{ length }} words of content
```

## Advanced Implementation with Self-Improvement

Let's create a more sophisticated example that uses Latitude's chain feature to implement an iterative prompt refinement process:

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Advanced Meta Prompting
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.6
---

<step as="initial_prompt">
# Initial Meta Prompt Generation

I need to accomplish the following task:

{{ task_description }}

Generate a prompt that would help an AI complete this task effectively. Consider:
- The specific goal to be achieved
- The expected format of the output
- Any constraints that must be followed
- The target audience for the result
- The level of detail required

## Generated Prompt:
</step>

<step as="prompt_critique">
# Meta Prompt Critique

Analyze the following prompt that was created to accomplish this task:

## Task:
{{ task_description }}

## Generated Prompt:
{{ initial_prompt }}

Now critique this prompt based on the following criteria:
1. **Clarity**: Is the prompt clear and unambiguous?
2. **Specificity**: Does it provide enough guidance on what exactly is needed?
3. **Constraints**: Does it properly communicate any limitations or requirements?
4. **Example Guidance**: Could examples help make the expectations clearer?
5. **Structure**: Is the prompt structured in a way that guides the AI's response format?

## Prompt Critique:
Identify at least 3 specific ways this prompt could be improved.
</step>

<step>
# Final Optimized Prompt

Based on the initial prompt and critique, create an improved, optimized prompt:

## Original Task:
{{ task_description }}

## Initial Prompt:
{{ initial_prompt }}

## Critique Points:
{{ prompt_critique }}

## Optimized Final Prompt:
Create a new and improved version of the prompt that addresses the critique points while maintaining the core objectives of the task.
</step>
```
</CodeGroup>

In this advanced example:

1. **Multi-Step Process**: We separate prompt generation, critique, and refinement
2. **Self-Critique**: The model evaluates its own prompt against specific criteria
3. **Iterative Improvement**: The final prompt incorporates learnings from the critique

## Meta Prompt Selection

Generate multiple prompts and select the best one:

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Meta Prompt Selection
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.8
---

<step as="prompt_variants">
# Generate Prompt Variants

For the following task, generate 3 different prompting approaches, each with a different strategy:

## Task:
{{ task_description }}

## Prompt Variant 1 - Direct Instruction Style:
Create a prompt that uses clear, direct instructions with step-by-step guidance.

## Prompt Variant 2 - Role-Based Style:
Create a prompt that assigns a specific expert role to the AI and frames the request within that context.

## Prompt Variant 3 - Example-Based Style:
Create a prompt that uses examples (few-shot learning) to demonstrate the expected output format and quality.
</step>

<step as="prompt_evaluation">
# Evaluate Prompt Variants

Analyze these three prompt variants for the task:

## Task:
{{ task_description }}

## Prompt Variants:
{{ prompt_variants }}

For each prompt variant, evaluate:
1. **Likely Effectiveness**: How well will it guide the AI to complete the task?
2. **Clarity**: How clear are the instructions?
3. **Adaptability**: How well would it handle edge cases?
4. **Efficiency**: How concise is the prompt without sacrificing effectiveness?

Score each prompt on a scale of 1-10 for each criterion, and provide a brief explanation.

## Evaluation Results:
</step>

<step>
# Select Optimal Prompt

Based on the evaluation, select the best prompt variant or create a hybrid that combines the strengths of multiple variants.

## Evaluation Summary:
{{ prompt_evaluation }}

## Optimal Prompt Selection:
The optimal prompt for this task is:

[Provide the selected or hybrid prompt here]

## Reasoning:
