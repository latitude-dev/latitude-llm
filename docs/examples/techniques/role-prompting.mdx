## What is Role Prompting?

Role prompting is a technique where you assign the AI a specific role, profession, or persona to guide its responses. By taking on characteristics of experts, characters, or specific viewpoints, the AI can provide more targeted, contextual, and specialized responses.

## Why Use Role Prompting?

- **Specialized Knowledge**: Access domain-specific expertise and terminology
- **Consistent Perspective**: Maintain a specific viewpoint throughout conversations
- **Enhanced Context**: Better understanding of audience and communication style
- **Improved Accuracy**: Leverage professional standards and best practices
- **Engaging Interactions**: More natural and relatable communication
