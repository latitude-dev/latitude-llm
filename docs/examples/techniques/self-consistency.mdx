## What is Self-Consistency?

Self-consistency is a prompting technique that improves the reliability of AI reasoning by generating multiple responses to the same question and then selecting the most consistent answer through majority voting. This technique is particularly effective for complex reasoning tasks where a single response might be unreliable.

## Why Use Self-Consistency?

- **Improved Accuracy**: Multiple samples reduce the impact of random errors
- **Better Reasoning**: Helps identify the most logical solution path
- **Reduced Hallucinations**: Inconsistent responses are filtered out
- **Confidence Assessment**: Shows how certain the AI is about its answers
- **Complex Problem Solving**: Particularly effective for math, logic, and multi-step reasoning

## Basic Implementation in Latitude

Here's a simple self-consistency example for mathematical reasoning:

```markdown Mathematical Reasoning

provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.7

# Mathematical Problem Solving

Solve the following problem step by step. Show your reasoning clearly.

## Problem:
{{ math_problem }}

## Solution:
Let me work through this step by step:

1. **Understanding the problem:**

2. **Setting up the equation:**

3. **Solving step by step:**

4. **Final answer:**
```

## Advanced Implementation with Multiple Samples

Let's create a more sophisticated example that uses Latitude's chain feature to generate and compare multiple reasoning paths:

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Advanced Self-Consistency
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.8
---

<step>
# Reasoning Sample 1

Solve this problem using your preferred approach:

## Problem:
{{ reasoning_problem }}

## Solution Path 1:
Think through this step by step and provide your final answer.
</step>

<step>
# Reasoning Sample 2

Solve the same problem using a different approach if possible:

## Problem:
{{ reasoning_problem }}

## Solution Path 2:
Think through this step by step and provide your final answer.
</step>

<step>
# Reasoning Sample 3

Solve the problem one more time, focusing on accuracy:

## Problem:
{{ reasoning_problem }}

## Solution Path 3:
Think through this step by step and provide your final answer.
</step>

<step>
# Self-Consistency Analysis

Review the three solution paths above and determine the most consistent answer:

## Analysis:
1. **Compare the final answers:** Are they the same or different?
2. **Evaluate reasoning quality:** Which path has the most sound logic?
3. **Identify consensus:** What answer appears most frequently?

## Final Consistent Answer:
Based on the analysis above, the most reliable answer is:

**Answer:**
**Confidence Level:**
**Reasoning:**
</step>
```
</CodeGroup>

In this advanced example:

1. **Multiple Sampling**: We generate three independent solutions with higher temperature for diversity
2. **Chain Processing**: Each step builds on the previous ones for comparison
3. **Consistency Analysis**: A final step evaluates and selects the best answer
4. **Confidence Assessment**: The system provides a confidence level based on agreement

## Logic and Reasoning Self-Consistency

## Problem:
{{ logic_problem }}

## Inductive Solution:
Look for patterns and make generalizations:

1. **Observe patterns:**
2. **Form hypothesis:**
3. **Test and conclude:**
</step>

<step>
# Abductive Reasoning Approach

Solve using abductive reasoning (inference to best explanation):

## Problem:
{{ logic_problem }}

## Abductive Solution:
Find the most likely explanation:

1. **Observations:**
2. **Possible explanations:**
3. **Best explanation:**
</step>

# Logic Consensus

- **Strongest reasoning:** Which approach provides the most convincing logic?
- **Consistency score:** How well do the results align?

## Final Answer:
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Adaptive Self-Consistency

Create prompts that adjust based on initial consistency. You can [play with it here](https://app.latitude.so/share/d/2a66d7c5-841d-4217-81cb-f97610ac9374)

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Adaptive Self-Consistency
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4.1-mini
temperature: 0.7
---

<step>
# Initial Sample Generation

Generate 3 initial solutions:

## Problem: {{ problem }}

### Solution 1:
### Solution 2:
### Solution 3:
</step>
<step as="consistency_check" schema={{{type: "object", properties: {additional_samples: {type: "boolean"}}, required: ["additional_samples"]}}}>
# Check Initial Consistency

  Evaluate the consistency of initial samples

## Consistency Analysis:
  - Are the answers consistent? (Yes/No)
  - Confidence level in consensus: (1-10)
  - Need for additional samples: (Yes/No)

## Decision:
  If consistency is low (< 7/10), recommend generating 2-3 additional samples.
  If consistency is high (â‰¥ 7/10), proceed with current consensus.
</step>

{{ if consistency_check.additional_samples }}
  <step>
    Generate 2 more solutions using different approaches:

    ## Problem: {{ problem }}

    ### Solution 4:
    ### Solution 5:

  </step>
{{ endif }}

# Final Consensus
Based on all available samples, determine the final answer:

2. **Reasoning Confidence**: How confident was each reasoning path?
3. **Method Agreement**: Do different methods agree?
4. **Edge Case Handling**: How well are corner cases addressed?

## Uncertainty Metrics:
- **Consensus Strength**: (0-100%)
- **Reasoning Diversity**: (Low/Medium/High)
- **Confidence Interval**: (if applicable)
- **Uncertainty Sources**: (List main sources of disagreement)

## Final Answer with Uncertainty:
**Most Likely Answer:**
**Confidence Level:**
**Alternative Possibilities:**

## Integration with Other Techniques

Self-consistency works well combined with other prompting techniques:

- **Chain-of-Thought + Self-Consistency**: Generate multiple detailed reasoning chains
- **Few-Shot + Self-Consistency**: Use examples to guide consistent reasoning patterns
- **Role-Playing + Self-Consistency**: Have different expert personas solve the same problem
- **Iterative Refinement + Self-Consistency**: Use consensus to improve solution quality

The key is to maintain the core principle: generate multiple independent solutions and use agreement as a signal of reliability.
