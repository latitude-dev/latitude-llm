## What is Tree of Thoughts?

Tree of Thoughts (ToT) is an advanced prompting technique that enables AI models to explore multiple reasoning paths in parallel, evaluate their potential, and select the most promising branches to develop furtherâ€”similar to how humans explore different solutions when tackling complex problems.

## Why Use Tree of Thoughts?

- **Improved Problem-Solving**: Systematically explore multiple solution pathways
- **Better Planning**: Map out different approaches before committing to one
- **Enhanced Creativity**: Generate diverse solutions to open-ended problems
- **Reduced Errors**: Catch mistakes by comparing different reasoning branches
- **Complex Decision-Making**: Break down complex decisions into evaluable components

## Basic Implementation in Latitude

## Multi-Agent ToT

Implement Tree of Thoughts with agent collaboration, you can [play with it here](https://app.latitude.so/share/d/6daaa005-cc77-4009-9150-f905505233eb).

<CodeGroup>
```markdown Multi-Agent
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.3
type: agent
agents:
  - agents/creator
  - agents/critic
  - agents/synthesizer
---

# Multi-Agent Tree of Thoughts

Solve the following problem using a collaborative multi-agent Tree of Thoughts approach:

**Problem**: {{ problem_statement }}

## Process:
1. The **creator** agent will generate multiple solution branches
2. The **critic** agent will evaluate each branch's strengths and weaknesses
3. The **synthesizer** agent will select and refine the most promising approach

Let's begin solving this step by step.
```

```markdown Creator Agent
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.7
type: agent
path: agents/creator
---

# Creator Agent: Thought Branch Generation

Generate three distinct approaches to solving the problem.

For each approach:
1. Use different first principles or starting assumptions
2. Explore creative and unexpected angles
3. Trace the logical steps from premise to conclusion

Don't evaluate the branches yet - focus on diversity of thought.
```

```markdown Critic Agent
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.1
type: agent
path: agents/critic
---

# Critic Agent: Branch Evaluation

Carefully evaluate each of the thought branches provided.

For each branch:
1. Identify logical fallacies or unwarranted assumptions
2. Check alignment with known facts and constraints
3. Consider edge cases and exceptions
4. Assign a confidence score and explain reasoning

Be rigorous and analytical in your assessment.
```

```markdown Synthesizer Agent
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.3
type: agent
path: agents/synthesizer
---

# Synthesizer Agent: Solution Development

Based on the generated branches and their evaluations:

1. Select the most promising approach OR
2. Create a hybrid solution incorporating the strongest elements

Then develop this approach in detail, addressing:
- Any weaknesses identified by the critic
- Practical implementation steps
- Expected outcomes
```

## Best Practices for Tree of Thoughts

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Thought Branch Design">
**Effective Branch Creation**:
- Create branches that start from genuinely different premises or approaches
- Ensure sufficient diversity between branches to explore the solution space
- Balance breadth (number of branches) with depth (steps in each branch)
- Use structured formats that make branches easy to compare

**Branch Evaluation**:
- Define clear evaluation criteria upfront
- Assign quantitative scores when possible
- Document reasoning for evaluations
- Consider both short-term solutions and long-term implications
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Implementation Tips">
**Technical Implementation**:
- Use parameters to control branch count, depth, and evaluation criteria
- Balance temperature settings - higher for branch generation, lower for evaluation
- Use larger context models (GPT-4) for complex ToT problems
- Store intermediate results in variables for complex multi-step ToT

**Process Optimization**:
- Start with 2-3 branches for simpler problems, 4-5 for complex ones
- Consider 3-5 steps of reasoning per branch as a starting point
- Use Latitude's chain feature for structured ToT implementation
- Try different branch combination methods (best single, hybrid, weighted)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Problem Selection">
**Ideal Problem Types**:
- **Strategic Planning**: Multiple viable approaches with complex tradeoffs
- **Creative Challenges**: Open-ended problems with no clear "right" answer
- **Analysis Tasks**: Situations requiring consideration of multiple perspectives

- **Troubleshooting**: Problems where the root cause isn't immediately obvious

**Less Suitable Problems**:
- Simple factual queries with definitive answers
- Highly constrained problems with limited solution paths
- Routine tasks with established procedures
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Advanced Techniques">
**ToT Variations**:
- **Recursive ToT**: Apply ToT within branches of a larger ToT structure
- **Adversarial ToT**: Intentionally create opposing branches to stress-test solutions
- **Collaborative ToT**: Distribute branches across multiple specialized agents
- **Time-Horizon ToT**: Create branches exploring short, medium, and long-term impacts
- **Probabilistic ToT**: Assign probability weights to different branches

**Integration with Other Techniques**:

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

<Warning>
**Avoid These Common Mistakes**:
- **Shallow Branches**: Creating branches that aren't meaningfully different from each other
- **Premature Evaluation**: Judging branches before they're fully developed
- **Confirmation Bias**: Favoring branches that align with preconceptions
- **Neglecting Constraints**: Failing to consider real-world limitations
- **Excessive Complexity**: Creating too many branches or too much depth for the problem
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Pro Tips**:
- Start with a clear problem statement before branching
- Use different cognitive approaches for each branch (analytical, creative, critical)
- Consider allocating more tokens to the most promising branches
- Document your reasoning at each step for transparency
- Try different branch-recombination methods for complex problems
