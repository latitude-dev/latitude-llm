description: Explanation of the Repository
---

The respository for Latitude is a monorepo with three main directories:

1. **Docs**: This is where all [docs](https://docs.latitude.so/guides/getting-started/introduction) are saved, written in markdown, and hosted in [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) 
2. **Apps**: Here is where all Latitude's different applications are gathered
3. **Packages**: An interactive Node REPL that automatically loads the database client, schema models, and utility helpers, letting you poke around a live Latitude instance on the fly

# 1. Docs 

The documentation has 4 primary sections:
1. **Latitude**: Principally about the functioning of the Latitude Platform.
2. **PromptL**: Latitude's Prompting Language.
3. **Examples**: Examples of agents made with Latitude.
4. **Changelog**: Log of notable changes made to the project.

# 2. Apps 

## Gateway (Main API)

**Purpose:** The main API used by frontend and SDKs

**Technologies:** Hono, OpenAPI

**Status:** Active

---

Enforces authentication by bearer API key and rate limiting specs by workspace plan or IP quotas before doing anything.

Currently there are:

- 3 main versions of the API, saved in `apps/gateway/src/routes/api`
- A webhook system currently used for the email system

The business logic of these endpoints is stored separately in `packages/core` which is also reused in other parts of the code.

**Architecture Pattern:**

```
┌────────────────────┐          ┌────────────────────┐          ┌────────────────────┐
│                    │          │                    │          │                    │
│  Data Model Object │──────────▶      Presenter     │──────────▶  Client Response   │
│                    │          │                    │          │                    │
└────────────────────┘          └────────────────────┘          └────────────────────┘
       Contains                       (Optional)                   Contains only what
     all properties              Serializes/Transforms           the client needs to see
                                     data model                                            
```

Abstractions:

- errorHandling abstraction (`errorHandlingMiddleware`) that serializes errors to OpenAPI error schema.
- Datadog/OTel tags for user, workspace & HTTP status (`tracerMiddleware`)

Testing:

- Integration tests in this app are primarily used, Factories are implemented to create entities.
- If a database is needed for a test, a custom built transaction object is used, `Transaction`, per test, that includes additional logic of retries and more that is useful for our tests (**use it even for 1 row!!)**

### Web (Frontend UI)

**Purpose:** The UI interface of [Latitude.so](http://Latitude.so)

**Technologies:** React, TS, NextJS

**Status:** Active

---

The pages can be found in route: `apps/web/src/app`

There are two main folders that separate views:

- **Private** - The logged-in user views (i.e. datasets, projects, experiments…)
- **Public** - The views that any user can see (i.e. login page)

The remaining folders are smaller parts:

- **Onboarding** - Views for the onboarding flow
- **Admin** - Views for the back office feature

To obtain or modify information from the backend, *stores* are used  [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)

To do **write actions to data models,** -> [*server actions*](https://nextjs.org/docs/14/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) from NextJS

They are modularized them into directories for each model object (i.e. documents, commits, etc.). You can find them in `apps/web/src/actions`

💡 The idea behind this is to group all write actions in one place

To do **reads,** -> NextJS App routes that call backend services

A Redis cache is used around the code if needed.

Tests are created using Vitest to verify:

- API routes and server actions
- Business logic helpers (utilities and action factories)
- E2E behaviour (for some critical flows like ingestion, document import…)

<Warning>

Prompts are referred to as documents in the code.

### Websockets (Real-time Communication)

**Purpose:** Middleman server for real-time communication

**Technologies:** WebSockets, JWT, TSUP

Built and bundled using [TSUP](https://github.com/egoist/tsup), and dockerized via the Dockerfile.

**Status:** Active

---

A websocket server used as a middleman server between the frontend client (apps/web) and the backend (workers) to establish a websocket connection for:

- Real time logs
- Latte

Its built and bundled using [TSUP](https://github.com/egoist/tsup), and dockerized via the Dockerfile.

**High level flow:**

1. The WS connection can be opened by the worker or the webclient, sending HTTP `POST /worker-events`
2. Authentication is later done using JWT stored in a cookie (`websocket`) or a bearer token from a worker
3. WS server places the socket in a workspace room (workspace:{id}) so every user in the same workspace hears the same updates.
4. Backend workers fire internal events (i.e. dataset rows created) to `POST /worker-events`; then the WS server rebroadcasts to the right room.
5. Frontend client uses `LatitudeWebsocketsProvider` to reconnect, auto-refresh expired tokens, and listen with React hooks to any updates from the workers

### Workers (Background Job Processing)

**Purpose:** Asynchronous task execution system

**Technologies:** BullMQ, Redis, TSUP

**Status:** Active

---

This is an async system that manages the execution of tasks, with configurable priorities, in an asynchronous fashion.

API layer pushes jobs into the Redis queue, from which later dedicated workers pull the jobs off and run them concurrently in the background.

Each worker has a configuration for:

- Jobs to do
- Queues to subscribe
- Worker options (common connection for BullMQ workers, and amount of jobs a worker can do in parallel)

- **Example of worker**     

Here's a simple diagram to explain the worker queue system:

```
┌───────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌───────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐      ┌────────────────┐      ┌────────────────┐
│           │     │           │     │               │     │                 │      │                │      │                │

│           │     │           │     │               │     │                 │      │                │      │                │

                                   └───────────────┘
```

This diagram illustrates how:

1. The API layer publishes events (this means pushing events to the event queue)
2. Dedicated workers pull these events from the queue and process them concurrently in the background
3. Each worker has specific configurations for jobs, queues to subscribe to, and worker options (including BullMQ connections and concurrency settings)
4. Each event has a handler which maps to what jobs it entails (`packages/core/src/events/handlers`), and these job implementations are also defined the core package, which calls backend services behind the scenes, etc.
5. Updates can be sent to clients via websockets for real-time feedback

# 3. Packages

Here is where we gather many different parts of the application, used within the apps or standalone:

### CLI

**Purpose:** A **command-line interface (CLI) tool** for interacting with the backend or internal systems in a REPL-style environment.

**Status:** Active

### Compiler

**Purpose:** PromptL compiler. Takes a `.promptl` file (or raw prompt JSON) and returns a fully-typed message array, metadata, and chain representation used by the Gateway and SDKs.

**Status:** To be deprecated

### Constants

**Purpose:** Package that includes constants used within the code, reused both in the frontend, backend, SDKs, and more.

**Status:** Migrating - Some constants still in core package

### Core (Main Business Logic)

**Purpose:** This is the main package that includes most of the business logic used by apps.

**Status:** Active

---

This includes:

- **Services** - Business logic implementations
- **Database object schemas** - Object definitions
- **Job definitions** - Background job implementations
- **Database migrations** - Schema changes
- **Event handlers** - Functions that map events from the queue to job definitions
- **Lib** - Closet with interesting abstractions that can be reused (i.e. CamelCaseRecursive)
- **Mailers** - Mail templates used with React
- **Repositories** - Functions that contact the DB, which maintain tenancy using the workspaceId (currently migrating to include this attribute in all of the database tables)

Services tend to follow this structure:

- **Arguments:** 1. Payload, 2. DB Object
- **Return object:** Result object - Rust like abstraction object to return all objects, which will be of type ok if the response worked with the return object inside, or of error type if its an error, with the error as the payload.

### Env

**Purpose:** Environment variables needed throughout the code, such as DB keys, third party keys, etc.

**Status:** Active

### SDKs

**Purpose:** Implementation of the Python and TS SDKs.

**Status:** Active (TypeScript ~10% more updated)

---

There is supposed to be a 1 to 1 parity between both SDKs, however, TS is more up to date (10% discrepancy)

The SDK is mostly redirections to core services.

### Telemetry

**Purpose:** Telemetry package that is served to clients so that they can send and visualize otl-compatible traces/spans in Latitude.

**Status:** Active

---

### Web-ui

**Purpose:** Design system using React/Tailwind component library (built with shadcn/ui).

**Status:** Active

---
# Miscellaneous

## Testing

#### Automatic tests

To summarize testing in the repo:

- Unit tests in the core package, where dependencies are mocked to isolate responsibility
- Integration tests in the applications, such as gateway and web, using factories to instantiate objects

#### Manual testing

To set up development environment to test, you must have the repo pulled locally, along with the following:

- NodeJS v22 or above
- Docker, Docker desktop, and docker-compose (you can use OrbStack instead of Docker Desktop)
- Pnpm
- Git

This will allow for the website to run locally.
