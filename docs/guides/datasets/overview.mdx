<Note>
  The dataset generator has a limited run time, if you try to generate a huge
  dataset it will not work. For the best experience, we recommend either
  generating many rows of small data or a few rows with a large amount of data.
</Note>

Once the dataset is generated/uploaded, you can use it to run evaluations in batches. Learn how to do it in the [running evaluations](/guides/evaluations/running-evaluations#running-evaluations-in-batch-mode) guide.
