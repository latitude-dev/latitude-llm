## Overview

Datasets contain values to use as parameters for running evaluations in batches. For example, you can upload a dataset of customer support tickets and use it to evaluate the performance of a chatbot.

## How it works

To create a dataset, navigate to the "Datasets" page and click on the "Upload dataset" button. You'll see a form with the following fields:

- Name: The name of the dataset
- Delimiter: The delimiter used in the first row of the CSV file
- File: The file to upload

Click the "Create dataset" button to upload the dataset.

Once the dataset is uploaded, you can use it to run evaluations in batches. Learn how to do it in the [running evaluations](/guides/evaluations/running-evaluations#running-evaluations-in-batch-mode) guide.
