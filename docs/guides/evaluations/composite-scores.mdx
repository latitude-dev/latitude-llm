title: Composite Scores
description: Combine the results of multiple evaluations into a single score.
---

Composite Score evaluations combine multiple existing evaluations into a unified score. This is ideal for measuring overall quality by aggregating various aspects of your prompt's performance, such as combining accuracy, safety, and relevance metrics into one comprehensive assessment.

- **How it works**: Takes the results from multiple existing evaluations and combines them using different mathematical approaches (average, weighted, or custom formula).
- **Best for**: Holistic quality assessment, combining multiple evaluation criteria, creating overall performance metrics, balancing trade-offs between different aspects (e.g., accuracy vs. safety).
- **Requires**: At least two existing evaluations configured on the same prompt. These evaluations can be of any type, even other Composite Scores!

<Note>
  Currently, composite evaluations cannot run in live mode and only support
  sub-evaluations that do not require an expected output. Check out the [Running
  Evaluations](/guides/evaluations/running-evaluations) guide.

## Metrics

<ParamField path='Average'>
  Combines scores evenly. The resulting score is the average.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='Weighted'>
  Combines scores using custom weights. The resulting score is the weighted
  blend. Weights are measured in percentage and must add up to 100%.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='Custom'>
  Combines scores using a custom formula. The resulting score is the result of
  the expression. The expression can be a complex mathematical formula.
</ParamField>
