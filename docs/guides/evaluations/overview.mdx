Evaluations are crucial for understanding and improving the quality of your AI prompt responses. Latitude provides a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess performance against various criteria.

## Why Evaluate Prompts?

- **Measure Quality**: Objectively assess if prompts meet desired standards (accuracy, relevance, tone, safety, etc.).
- **Identify Weaknesses**: Pinpoint scenarios where prompts underperform.
- **Compare Versions**: Quantify the impact of prompt changes (A/B testing).
- **Drive Improvement**: Gather data to refine prompts using [Prompt Suggestions](/guides/evaluations/prompt-suggestions).
- **Ensure Reliability**: Build confidence in production-deployed prompts.

## Evaluation Types in Latitude

Latitude supports three main approaches to evaluation, each suited for different needs:

1.  [**LLM-as-Judge**](/guides/evaluations/llm-as-judges):

    - **How it works**: Uses another language model (the "judge") to score or critique the output of your target prompt based on specific criteria (e.g., helpfulness, clarity, adherence to instructions).
    - **Best for**: Subjective criteria, complex assessments, evaluating nuanced qualities like creativity or tone.
    - **Requires**: Defining evaluation criteria (often via templates or custom instructions for the judge LLM).

2.  [**Programmatic Rules**](/guides/evaluations/programmatic_rules):

    - **How it works**: Applies code-based rules and metrics to check outputs against objective criteria.
    - **Best for**: Objective checks, ground truth comparisons (using datasets), format validation (JSON, regex), safety checks (keyword detection), length constraints.
    - **Requires**: Defining specific rules (e.g., exact match, contains keyword, JSON schema validation) and potentially providing a [Dataset](/guides/datasets/overview) with expected outputs.

3.  [**Human-in-the-Loop (Manual Evaluations)**](/guides/evaluations/humans-in-the-loop):
    - **How it works**: Team members manually review prompt outputs (logs) and assign scores or labels based on their judgment.
    - **Best for**: Capturing nuanced human preferences, evaluating criteria difficult for LLMs to judge, initial quality assessment, creating golden datasets for other evaluation types.
    - **Requires**: Setting up manual review workflows and criteria for reviewers.

## How Evaluations Connect to Prompts

- **Per-Prompt Basis**: Evaluations are configured individually for each prompt within a project.
- **Target Logs**: Evaluations run on the [Logs](/guides/logs/overview) generated by their associated prompt.
- **Triggering**: Evaluations can be run manually on batches of logs/datasets or automatically on incoming logs (live mode). See [Running Evaluations](/guides/evaluations/running-evaluations).
- **Results**: Evaluation results (scores, labels, feedback) are stored alongside the corresponding logs, providing a rich dataset for analysis and improvement.

## Negative Evaluations

Sometimes, you want to measure undesirable traits (e.g., toxicity, hallucination presence), where a _lower_ score is better. Latitude allows you to mark evaluations as "negative".

1. Go to the evaluation's settings by clicking on the right-side button in the evaluation detail:

2. Click on **Advandced configuration**
2. Configure whether a higher or lower score indicates better performance.

- The [Prompt Suggestions](/guides/evaluations/prompt-suggestions) feature will use this setting to optimize correctly.
