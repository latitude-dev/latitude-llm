Latitude is an open-source platform for AI prompt engineering, deployment, and evaluation. It helps teams build, test, and maintain reliable AI applications by providing a complete lifecycle management system for prompts.

With Latitude, you can:

- Design and version prompts collaboratively
- Test iterations in an interactive playground
- Deploy prompts as API endpoints
- Monitor performance with automatic logging
- Evaluate and improve prompts systematically

Latitude is designed for cross-functional teams, enabling collaboration between developers, product managers, and domain experts throughout the entire AI development process.

## Key Features at a Glance

- **Prompt Manager**: Create, version, and collaborate on prompts with a powerful editor supporting advanced features like variables, conditionals, and loops through PromptL
- **Playground**: Test prompts interactively with different inputs, parameters, and tool configurations
- **AI Gateway**: Deploy prompts as API endpoints that stay up-to-date with published changes
- **Datasets**: Manage test data for batch evaluations and regression testing
- **Evaluations**: Assess prompt performance via LLM-as-judge, programmatic rules, or human review
- **Run experiments**: Use datasets and associtated evaluations to run batch experiments over 2 or more prompts variations.
- **Logs & Observability**: Automatically capture all interactions with prompts and models
- **Integrations**: Seamlessly integrate with your existing stack via SDKs and APIs

## How Latitude Works

The Latitude workflow helps teams move from prompt experimentation to production deployment and continuous improvement:

1. **Design**: Create and iterate on prompts using the Prompt Manager
2. **Test**: Validate behavior in the Playground with test inputs
3. **Deploy**: Publish prompts as endpoints through the AI Gateway or render them locally with the SDKs
4. **Monitor**: Automatically log and observe production interactions
5. **Evaluate**: Assess performance using various evaluation methods
6. **Improve**: Refine prompts automatically and/or on-demand based on evaluation insights
