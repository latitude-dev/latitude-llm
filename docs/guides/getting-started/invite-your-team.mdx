## Invite Your Team

Latitude is designed to be a collaborative platform, as such you can invite your team members to your workspace.

## How to invite your team?

1. Navigate to the Settings page.
1. Look for the "Workspace Members" section.
1. Click on the "Add Members" button.
1. In the modal that appears, enter the name and email address of the team member you want to invite.
1. Click the "Send Invite" button to send out the invitations.

When an invited user accepts the invitation, they become a member of your workspace. If they already have a Latitude account with their own workspaces, your workspace is added to their account alongside their existing ones.

## Working Across Multiple Workspaces

Latitude supports multiple workspaces per user. A single account can belong to any number of workspaces, whether created by you or joined through invitations from others.

Each workspace is fully isolated: projects, prompts, evaluations, datasets, provider configurations, API keys, and team members are all scoped to the workspace they belong to. Subscription plans and usage limits are also tracked per workspace.

### Switching Workspaces

If you belong to more than one workspace, a workspace switcher appears in the navigation bar. Select any workspace to switch to it instantly without logging out. Your session moves to the selected workspace and you'll see its projects and settings.

### Creating Additional Workspaces

You can create new workspaces from the workspace switcher in the navigation bar. This is useful when you need to:

- Separate work for different teams or departments
- Manage distinct client projects with their own provider keys and team access
- Maintain isolated environments for experimentation
