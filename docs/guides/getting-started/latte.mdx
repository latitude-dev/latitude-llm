Create, debug, and optimize your Latitude prompts and projects with real-time, context-aware AI assistance.

**Latte** is the official built-in assistant on the Latitude platform. Always ready in the sidebar, Latte helps you write, structure, and manage PromptL prompts, projects, and integrations, making prompt engineering faster, easier, and more reliable.

## What is Latte?

Latte is an AI-powered assistant designed to help you:

- Create agents from a simple description
- Write and debug PromptL prompts  
- Apply best practices from Latitude's documentation  
- Search and cite Latitude docs with inline sources  
- Manage projects, drafts, and versions  
- Edit prompts (only with your approval)

Latte is always **context-aware**, meaning it tailors help based on your current workspace, whether that’s a specific project, prompt, or version.

## How Latte Works

### Context Awareness
Latte understands where you are in the app (project, prompt, version) and responds accordingly.

### Documentation Integration
Latte can answer questions using built-in knowledge or by searching the official [Latitude Documentation](https://docs.latitude.so). Responses are cited when needed.

### Safe Editing
Latte only edits draft prompts, and only when **you approve**. Changes are shown as clear diffs.

### Transparent Reasoning
Latte explains its reasoning and steps for complex tasks, helping you learn while you work.

## Using Latte: Examples

### Get PromptL Syntax Help
**Example:**  
> _"How do I use loops in PromptL?"_  
Latte will explain syntax, show examples, and provide links to relevant docs.

### Debug a Prompt
**Example:**  
> _"Can you review my prompt for errors?"_  
Latte will scan your current draft, flag issues, and suggest or apply fixes (with your OK).

### Edit a Prompt
**Example:**  
> _"Edit my draft to add a schema for JSON output."_  
Latte will propose the update, show the diff, and explain the change.

## Best Practices for Using Latte

- **Be specific**: The more context you give, the better Latte can help.  
- **Work in drafts**: Latte only edits prompts that are in draft mode.  
- **Ask for explanations**: Unsure about a suggestion? Ask Latte to explain or cite docs.  
- **Review diffs**: Always check what’s being changed before approving edits.  
- **Use doc links**: Dive deeper into any topic via Latte’s inline links to official docs.
