## Overview

Providers in Latitude are the foundation for connecting to various AI models and services.

The name you introduce for each provider will be the one you will have to use in your prompts.

## Creating a New Provider

You can add more than one provider. To create a new provider:

1. Go to the "Settings" section
1. On the "Providers" section click on the "Create Provider" button
1. Fill out the configuration:
    1. **Provider**: Choose the AI service provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq) or 'Custom' (instances like Ollama or Gpustack, compatible with the OpenAI API format).
    1. **ID**: Enter an alias for this provider configuration. This will be the name you have to use in the prompt editor.
    1. **Token**: Input your API key or access token for the selected provider.
    1. **URL**: Only for 'Custom', enter the base URL (the part before /chat/completions)
1. Click "Create Provider" to save your new provider
1. Now you can use it in your prompts

## Using Providers in Prompts

Once you've set up a provider, you can use it in your prompts:

1. Open the Prompt editor
1. Create a new prompt or edit an existing one
1. In the prompt configuration, select your desired provider from the dropdown menu or in the code
