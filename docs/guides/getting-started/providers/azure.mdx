## How do I set the Azure OpenAI Service resource name?

The [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/create-resource) requires a resource name to be set.

To do this, add `resourceName: name-of-your-azure-resource` to the `azure` config in the front matter of your prompt.

```markdown {4-5}
---
provider: name-of-your-azure-provider-in-latitude
model: gpt-4o-mini
azure:
  resourceName: name-of-your-azure-resource
---
```

## How do I set the Azure OpenAI API version?

The [Azure OpenAI API version](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/api-version-deprecation) is optional, by default is `2024-10-01-preview`, but it is recommended to pin it to your desired version.

To do this, add `apiVersion: version-of-your-choice` to the `azure` config in the front matter of your prompt.

```markdown {4-6}
---
provider: name-of-your-azure-provider-in-latitude
model: gpt-4o-mini
azure:
  resourceName: name-of-your-azure-resource
  apiVersion: version-of-your-choice
---
```
