## How do I set the Google Gemini safety settings?

The [Google Gemini safety settings](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/safety-settings) are opt-in configurations that provide a first layer of security for your prompts.

To do this, add `safetySettings: list-of-safety-settings` to the `google` config in the front matter of your prompt.

```markdown {4-9}

      threshold: BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE
