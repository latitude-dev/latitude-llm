## How do I set the OpenAI endpoint?

You can use either the classic OpenAI [Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) or [Responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) endpoints.

To select your preferred endpoint when creating the provider, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Settings** section.
2. Click on **Providers**.
3. Select **OpenAI** from the list of providers.
4. Choose the endpoint you want to use.

<Note>
  Once you select an endpoint, all prompts using this provider will use that same endpoint.
</Note>

When using [Responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses), you can access OpenAI's [built-in tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools?api-mode=responses) such as web search.
