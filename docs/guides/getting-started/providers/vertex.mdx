## How do I set the Google Vertex provider?

You need to setup a service account with the right permissions in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials). Once you download the JSON file you will find inside all the required information to setup the provider in Latitude.

1. `project`: The project ID in Google Cloud.
2. `location`: The location of the Vertex AI endpoint. Ex.: `europe-west1` or `us-central1`.
3. `clientEmail`: The email of the service account.
4. `privateKeyId`: The private key ID of the service account.
5. `privateKey`: The private key of the service account.
