This is a response from an NPS survey:

Score out of 10: {{ score }}
Message: {{ message }}

Analyze the sentiment based on both the score and message. Prioritize identifying the primary concern in the feedback, focusing on the core issue mentioned by the user. Categorize the sentiment into one of the following categories:

- Product Features and Functionality
- User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)
- Performance and Reliability
- Customer Support and Service
- Onboarding and Learning Curve
- Pricing and Value Perception
- Integrations and Compatibility
- Scalability and Customization
- Feature Requests and Product Roadmap
- Competitor Comparison
- General Feedback (Neutral/Non-specific)

Return only one of the categories.
```

The prompt is automatically saved as you write it.

<Note>
  Notice how every prompt run has a human-in-the-loop evaluation automatically
  generated for it
</Note>
## 4. Test in the Playground

1. In the prompt editor, notice the parameter inputs in the right side
2. Fill in the parameter values:
   - `score`: "5"
   - `message`: "Product is working but occasionally laggy."
3. Click "Run" in the bottom right corner to see the generated output
4. Try different inputs to test how your prompt performs in various scenarios

## 5. Observe Results and Logs

1. Navigate to the "Logs" section
2. You'll see a record of all interactions with your prompt
3. Click on any log entry to view details including:
   - Input parameters
   - Generated output
   - Model used
   - Response time
   - Evaluation results (if available)
4. Use filters to find specific logs based on time, status, or content
5. Select logs and save them to a dataset

## Next Steps

Now that you've created and evaluated your first prompt at scale, you can:

- Share your endpoint with developers for integration
- Create more complex prompts using [PromptL syntax](/promptl/syntax/structure)
- Set up [ongoing evaluations](/guides/evaluations/running-evaluations) to monitor quality
- [Invite team members](/guides/getting-started/invite-your-team) to collaborate
