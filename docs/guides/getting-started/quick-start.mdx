## Overview

This quick start guide will walk you through the process of setting up and using Latitude, whether you choose to use Latitude Cloud or self-host the platform. By the end of this guide, you'll have created your first prompt, tested it, and learned how to evaluate and deploy it.

Latitude offers two deployment options:

1. **Latitude Cloud**: A fully managed solution that allows you to get started quickly without worrying about infrastructure.
2. **Latitude Self-Hosted**: An open-source version that you can deploy and manage on your own infrastructure for complete control and customization.

Choose the option that best fits your needs and follow the corresponding instructions below.

## Latitude Cloud

To get started with Latitude, follow these steps:

1. **Sign up for Latitude**: Visit our [website](https://latitude.so) and follow the instructions to create your account.

2. **Create a new project**: Once logged in, create a new project to organize your prompts and evaluations.

3. **Write your first prompt**: Navigate to the Editor and create a new prompt. Start with a simple task, like generating a short story or answering a question.

4. **Test your prompt**: Use the playground to test your prompt with different inputs and see the model's responses.

5. **Evaluate in batch**: Before deploying, you can upload a dataset and run a batch evaluation to assess your prompt's performance across various scenarios.

6. **Deploy your prompt**: Once you're satisfied with your prompt's performance in batch evaluation, deploy it as an endpoint for easy integration with your applications.

7. **Monitor and evaluate**: Use the Logs section to review your prompt's performance over time. Set up ongoing evaluations to systematically assess and improve your prompt's output.

8. **Iterate and improve**: Based on the evaluation results, refine your prompt or create new versions to enhance its performance.

9. **Collaborate with your team**: Invite team members to your Latitude workspace to collaborate on prompt engineering and evaluations.

## Latitude Self-Hosted

Follow the instructions in the [self-hosted guide](https://docs.latitude.so/guides/self-hosted/production) to get started with Latitude Self-Hosted.

After setting up Latitude Self-Hosted, you can follow the same steps as in the Latitude Cloud guide to create, test, evaluate, and deploy your prompts.
