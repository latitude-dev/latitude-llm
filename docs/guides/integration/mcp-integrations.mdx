description: Connect Latitude to other tools and services using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.
---

Latitude supports extending its capabilities by integrating with external tools and services through servers implementing the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. This allows you to connect Latitude prompts to systems like Slack, Notion, databases, or custom internal tools.

## What is an MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standardized way for AI platforms like Latitude to interact with external tools or "skills". An MCP server acts as a bridge:

1.  **Latitude Request**: When a Latitude prompt (often an [Agent](/guides/prompt-manager/agents)) needs to use an external tool, it sends a request to the configured MCP server.
2.  **MCP Server Action**: The MCP server receives the request, understands which tool is being called and with which arguments, and executes the corresponding action in the third-party system (e.g., sending a Slack message, querying a database, creating a Notion page).
3.  **MCP Server Response**: The MCP server sends the result of the action back to Latitude.
4.  **Latitude Continues**: Latitude receives the result and continues the prompt execution (e.g., the agent uses the information retrieved from the database).

## Setting Up an MCP Integration

The exact setup process depends on the specific MCP server you want to integrate.

### Option 1: Using Pre-built MCP Servers

Several open-source or third-party MCP servers might exist for common tools (check community resources or the specific tool's integrations).

1.  **Deploy the MCP Server**: Follow the server's instructions to deploy it (e.g., as a container, serverless function).
2.  **Configure in Latitude**: In your Latitude project settings (or potentially self-hosted configuration), add the MCP server's URL and any required authentication details.
3.  **Enable Tools in Prompts**: In your Latitude prompts, [enable the specific tools](/guides/prompt-manager/tools) provided by that MCP server in the `tools` configuration block.

### Option 2: Building a Custom MCP Server

If you need to connect to a custom internal tool or a service without a pre-built MCP server, you can build your own.

1.  **Choose a Framework**: Use any web server framework (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Flask, Go/Echo).
2.  **Implement MCP Endpoints**: Implement the required HTTP endpoints specified by the MCP protocol standard (details typically found in Latitude's advanced/developer documentation or community resources).
    - Handle incoming tool call requests from Latitude.
    - Parse tool names and arguments.
    - Interact with your target third-party service/API.
    - Format and return the results according to the MCP specification.
3.  **Deploy and Configure**: Deploy your custom server and configure it in Latitude as described in Option 1.

## Example Use Cases

- **Slack Integration**: An agent uses an MCP tool to send notifications or summaries to a Slack channel.
- **Notion Integration**: A prompt uses an MCP tool to create new pages or query databases within Notion.
- **Database Query**: An agent retrieves customer information from your internal database via a custom MCP server tool.
- **Calendar Management**: A prompt schedules meetings using an MCP tool connected to Google Calendar.

## Self-Hosting MCP Integrations

If you are [self-hosting Latitude](/guides/self-hosted/overview), you will also need to deploy and manage any required MCP servers within your own infrastructure and configure Latitude to communicate with them.
