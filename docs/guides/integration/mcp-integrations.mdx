description: Connect Latitude to other tools and services using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.
---

Latitude supports extending its capabilities by integrating with external tools and services through servers implementing the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. This allows you to connect Latitude prompts to systems like Slack, Notion, databases, or custom internal tools.

## What is an MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standardized way for AI platforms like Latitude to interact with external tools or "skills". An MCP server acts as a bridge:

1.  **Latitude Request**: When a Latitude prompt (often an [Agent](/guides/prompt-manager/agents)) needs to use an external tool, it sends a request to the configured MCP server.
2.  **MCP Server Action**: The MCP server receives the request, understands which tool is being called and with which arguments, and executes the corresponding action in the third-party system (e.g., sending a Slack message, querying a database, creating a Notion page).
3.  **MCP Server Response**: The MCP server sends the result of the action back to Latitude.
4.  **Latitude Continues**: Latitude receives the result and continues the prompt execution (e.g., the agent uses the information retrieved from the database).

## Setting Up an MCP Integration

The exact setup process depends on the specific MCP server you want to integrate. First thing is to go to [settings](https://app.latitude.so/settings) and scroll down **Integrations** section.

At the moment Latitude had some hosted MCP servers available. For example if you click on **Slack** you will see the following:

You can also point to a third-party MCP server by providing the URL of the server choosing **Custom MCP server**

## Example Use Cases

- **Slack Integration**: An agent uses an MCP tool to send notifications or summaries to a Slack channel.
- **Notion Integration**: A prompt uses an MCP tool to create new pages or query databases within Notion.
- **Database Query**: An agent retrieves customer information from your internal database via a custom MCP server tool.
- **Calendar Management**: A prompt schedules meetings using an MCP tool connected to Google Calendar.

## Self-Hosting MCP Integrations

If you are [self-hosting Latitude](/guides/self-hosted/production-setup), you will also need to deploy and manage any required MCP servers within your own infrastructure and configure Latitude to communicate with them.
