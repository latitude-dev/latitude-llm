description: Learn how to integrate Latitude into your applications using SDKs or the API.
---

Latitude provides multiple ways to integrate with your applications. You can use our SDKs for a simpler integration experience, or interact directly with our HTTP API. You can also choose whether to use Latitude as an AI Gateway or fetch prompts and upload logs yourself.

## SDKs

Latitude offers official SDKs for popular languages:

- **[Python SDK](/guides/sdk/python)** - For Python applications
- **[TypeScript SDK](/guides/sdk/typescript)** - For Node.js and browser applications

The SDKs handle authentication, request formatting, and response parsing automatically, making them the easiest way to integrate Latitude into your application.

## HTTP API

You can also interact with Latitude directly using the [HTTP API](/guides/api/api-access). This is useful if you're using a language without an official SDK, need more control over the request/response cycle, or are building custom integrations. The API provides full access to all Latitude features including prompt execution, log management, and evaluations.

## Integration Patterns

Latitude supports two main integration patterns:

### Use Latitude as an AI Gateway

With this pattern, Latitude acts as a proxy between your application and the underlying AI models. When you call Latitude's SDK or API:

1. Your application sends prompt parameters to Latitude
2. Latitude fetches the prompt, executes it using your configured provider, and handles all logging automatically
3. Your application receives the response directly

This is the simplest integration path and provides automatic logging and trace collection. You don't need to manage prompt execution yourself, and when you publish new prompt versions in Latitude, your application automatically uses them without any code changes.

Most applications use this pattern to leverage Latitude's prompt management and monitoring features. To get started, check out the [Publishing Prompts](/guides/integration/publishing-deployment) guide.

### Fetch Prompts and Upload Logs

With this pattern, you manage prompt execution yourself:

1. Your application fetches prompts from Latitude using the API or SDK's [`prompts.get()`](/guides/sdk/typescript#get-a-prompt) method
2. Your application executes the prompts using your own infrastructure (e.g., directly calling OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
3. Your application uploads logs back to Latitude using the [`logs.push()`](/guides/sdk/typescript#pushing-a-log-to-latitude) method or the [Upload Logs](/guides/logs/upload-logs) guide

This pattern gives you full control over prompt execution and lets you use your existing infrastructure and provider integrations. You still get all the benefits of Latitude's evaluation and monitoring tools.

This is best for applications that already have their own AI provider integrations and want to add Latitude's evaluation capabilities.

## Next Steps

- Use the [Python SDK](/guides/sdk/python) or [TypeScript SDK](/guides/sdk/typescript) to get started quickly
- Learn about the [HTTP API](/guides/api/api-access)
- Deploy your first prompt with the [Publishing Prompts](/guides/integration/publishing-deployment) guide
- Upload existing logs using the [Upload Logs](/guides/logs/upload-logs) guide
