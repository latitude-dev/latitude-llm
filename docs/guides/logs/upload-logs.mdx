## Upload logs to Latitude

Most users use Latitude's SDK to run their prompts via Latitude's AI Gateway. However, if you're using a different method to run your prompts, you can still upload logs to Latitude and evalute them in order to assess the quality of your outputs.

### Upload logs from Latitude's Dashboard

Navigate to your prompt's logs section and click on the **Upload logs** button. The following screen will appear:

You can upload a list of logs in a single csv file. The CSV file should be a single column csv where each row is a log, i.e a user-assitant interaction. [Here's an example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uxmUW2XhcqRB_cK0SBmHzUfa9xMqVzKZ0eT8umO8pr8/edit?usp=sharing) of a valid CSV file:

```csv
"[{""role"":""system"",""content"":""Tell me a joke about School""},{""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""Why did the math book look sad? Because it had too many problems!""}]"
"[{""role"":""system"",""content"":""Tell me a joke about Travel""}],{""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""Why did the hiker refuse to eat pizza on the way to the top of the mountain? Because he was afraid of heights and the pizza was too big!""}]"
"[{""role"":""system"",""content"":""Tell me a joke about Work""}],{""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""Why did the worker get fired from his job? Because he was not properly training for it!""}]"
"[{""role"":""system"",""content"":""Tell me a joke about Sports""}],{""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""Why did the sports star quit his job? Because he was not properly training for it!""}]"
```

<Note>
  Logs follow the [PromptL format](/promptl/getting-started/introduction). If
  you're using a different method to run your prompts, you'll need to format
  your logs accordingly.
</Note>

<Note type='warning'>Do not include headers in your CSV file.</Note>

Once you've uploaded your logs, they will quickly appear in your prompt's logs section.

### Evaluating uploaded logs

To evaluate your uploaded logs, make sure to first create an evaluation for your prompt. Also, make sure the evaluation is configured to [evaluate live logs](/guides/evaluations/running-evaluations#running-evaluations-in-live-mode).

Once you've set up your evaluation, upload your logs as described above and they will be automatically evaluated in real time.

### Upload logs from the SDK

You can push logs to Latitude with Latitude's SDK. Check out Latitude' SDK [`log` method](/guides/sdk/typescript#pushing-a-log-to-latitude).

### Upload logs from the API

You can create log entries in Latitude with Latitude's API: Check out Latitude's API [`create log entry`](/guides/api/api-access#9-create-log-entry)
