title: Prompt Configuration
description: Learn how to configure model, provider, and generation parameters for your prompts.
---

The configuration section, located at the top of every prompt file and enclosed by triple dashes (`---`), defines how Latitude executes your prompt. It's written in YAML format and allows you to specify the AI provider, model, generation parameters, and other advanced settings.

```yaml
---
provider: OpenAI
model: gpt-4o-mini
temperature: 0.6
top_p: 0.9
# ... other settings
---
```

## Core Settings

### Provider (required)

Specifies the AI provider to use (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). This must match a provider configured in your Latitude workspace settings.

You can easily select a configured provider using the dropdown in the editor's header.

### Model (required)

Specifies the exact language model to use (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`, `claude-3-opus-20240229`). Available models depend on the selected provider.

The model dropdown in the editor's header lists available models for the chosen provider.

## Generation Parameters

These parameters control how the AI model generates its response. The specific ranges and behaviors might vary slightly between providers.

### `temperature`

Controls the randomness of the output. Lower values (e.g., 0.1) make the output more deterministic and focused, while higher values (e.g., 0.9) increase creativity and randomness.

<Note>
  Setting temperature to 0, or leaving it unset, enables response
  [caching](/guides/prompt-manager/cache) for identical inputs.
</Note>

It's generally recommended to adjust _either_ `temperature` _or_ `topP`, but not both.

### `maxTokens`

Sets the maximum number of tokens (words or parts of words) the model can generate in its response.

### `topP` (Nucleus Sampling)

An alternative to `temperature` for controlling randomness. It instructs the model to consider only the most probable tokens whose cumulative probability mass exceeds the `topP` value (e.g., 0.9 means consider tokens comprising the top 90% probability mass).

### `topK`

Restricts the model to sampling only from the `K` most likely next tokens at each step. Generally used for advanced cases; `temperature` or `topP` are usually sufficient.

### `presencePenalty`

Discourages the model from repeating information already present in the prompt context. Higher values increase the penalty.

### `frequencyPenalty`

Discourages the model from using the same words or phrases repeatedly in its response. Higher values increase the penalty.

### `stopSequences`

A list of strings that, if generated by the model, will cause generation to stop immediately.

### `seed`

An integer used to initialize the random number generator. If supported by the model, using the same seed with identical inputs will produce deterministic outputs, useful for reproducibility.

## Advanced Configuration

### `parameters`

Defines types and constraints for input parameters used in the [Playground](/guides/prompt-manager/playground) or shared prompts.

```yaml
parameters:
  user_input:
    type: text # Default type
  image_upload:
    type: image
  data_file:
    type: file
```

[Learn more about parameter types in the Playground guide](/guides/prompt-manager/playground#parameter-types).

### `schema`

Defines a JSON schema to enforce structured output from the model.

[Learn more about enforcing JSON output](/guides/prompt-manager/json-output).

### `tools`

Lists the tools (functions) available for the AI model to call.

[Learn more about configuring tools](/guides/prompt-manager/tools).

### `maxSteps`

For [Chains](/promptl/advanced/chains) and [Agents](/guides/prompt-manager/agents), sets the maximum number of execution steps allowed (default: 20, max: 150).

### `maxRetries`

Maximum number of times to retry a provider call on failure (default: 2).

### `headers`

Sends additional HTTP headers with the request, useful for integrating with specific provider features or observability tools.
