The Latitude Prompt Editor is your central hub for designing, testing, and managing AI prompts. It provides a powerful interface built around **PromptL**, our specialized language for creating dynamic and structured prompts.

## Writing a Prompt using PromptL

At its core, the editor lets you write prompts using [PromptL syntax](/promptl/syntax/structure). This includes:

- **Configuration Block**: Define provider, model, and settings in the YAML frontmatter.
- **Messages**: Structure conversations using `<system>`, `<user>`, and `<assistant>` tags.
- **Advanced Features**: Utilize loops, conditionals, snippets, and more for complex logic.

```markdown
---
provider: openai
model: gpt-4o
temperature: 0.7
---

<system>
You are a helpful assistant.
</system>

<user>
Tell me a joke about {{ topic }}.
</user>
```

Explore the full power of PromptL in the [PromptL Syntax documentation](/promptl/syntax/structure).

## Adding Parameters and Variables

Make your prompts dynamic by using variables and parameters:

Define placeholders like `{{ topic }}` in your prompt. You can use, read, and write data from these variables all over your prompt.
All variables defined in the prompt without a value are automatically added as **Input Parameters**, which can be filled in via the
Playground or API calls.

Learn more about [Variables in PromptL](/promptl/syntax/variables).

Input parameters will automatically appear in the [Playground](/guides/prompt-manager/playground) for easy testing.

## Collaborating in the Editor

Latitude is built for teamwork:

- **Version Control**: Manage changes using drafts and published versions. See the [Version Control guide](/guides/prompt-manager/version-control) for details.
- **Shared Workspace**: Team members can view and edit prompts within the same project.
- **Comments**: Add `/* comments */` directly within the editor for feedback and discussion.
