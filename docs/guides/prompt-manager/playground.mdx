## Overview

The Prompt Playground is a powerful tool that allows you to test and refine your prompts before deploying them in your Latitude workspace. It provides a real-time preview of how your prompts will be executed, allowing you to fine-tune the configuration and content to achieve the desired results.

## Testing the Prompt

In the Playground, you will see a Preview of your prompt messages in real-time, displayed in a conversation format. This allows you to see how the prompt will be executed and what roles each participant will play.

You can run the prompt by clicking on the "Run prompt" button. This will send the displayed messages to your LLM provider and generate a response based on the configuration and content of the prompt, which will be included in the previewed conversation in real time.

After running the prompt, the preview will enter in Chat mode, where you will be able to follow the conversation flow and interact with the assistant as if it were a real conversation.

To leave Chat mode and rerun the prompt, click on the "Reset Chat" button.

## Parameters

Your prompts can include input parameters that will be interpolated into the messages at runtime. This allows you to create dynamic prompts that can respond to user input or external data.

[Learn more about using parameters in your prompts](/promptl/syntax/variables#input-parameters).

When parameters are present in your prompt, they will automatically appear in the Parameters section of the Playground. Here, you can provide values for the parameters and run the prompt to see how they affect the conversation.

### Parameter Types

Parameters can have different types. On the playground, and in shared prompts, this will affect how they are populated and interpolated into the messages. You can either change the parameter types in the configuration section of the prompt, or in the playground.
