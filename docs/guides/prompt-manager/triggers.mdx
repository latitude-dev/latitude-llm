## Overview
The Triggers feature enables automatic execution of prompts based on specific events or schedules. This documentation explains how to configure triggers via Email or Schedule and describes each available setting.

Triggers allow you to:

- Automate prompt runs when specific conditions are met (e.g., receiving an email, or on a set schedule).
- Define who can trigger prompts and under what circumstances.
- Configure parameters and access control for secure, contextual automation.

To access the triggers you have to click in the top right corner of the prompt playground

Users must provide these parameters when triggering the prompt by email.

**Email Settings**
- `Name` Give your email trigger a name (used to distinguish between triggers).
- `Prompt Email Address`: A unique email address is generated for your trigger
- `Reply with response`: Toggle to automatically reply to the sender with the promptâ€™s output.

## Schedule

Allows running a prompt on a fixed schedule, such as every hour, daily, or based on a cron expression.


<Note>You can combine a trigger with an MCP and built a automated workflow that runs a prompt on a schedule and sends the output to a specific channel.</Note>
