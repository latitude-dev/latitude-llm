# Starting Latitude with Docker Compose

Latitude can be easily deployed in a single machine using Docker Compose, which
will set up all required services including the web interface, API gateway,
workers, websockets, database, and Redis.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- A copy of the `.env` configuration file

## Configuration

1. First, create your environment configuration by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. For proper functioning of the project, you need to create a Docker network named web. This network is used for communication between the various services, including Traefik.

You can create the network using the following command:

```bash
docker network create web
```

Make sure this network is created before running the containers with `docker compose`.

3. Configure your `.env` file with your production settings. The following key configurations are available:

- **Traefik Settings**:

  - `TRAEFIK_ACME_EMAIL`: Email address used for Let's Encrypt ACME registration. Required for issuing and renewing SSL certificates. It is also used to receive expiration and renewal notifications.
  - `TRAEFIK_ADMIN_PASS`: Passwords must be hashed using MD5, SHA1, or BCrypt. Read more: https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/http/basicauth/
    Example command to generate a password for user admin:
    ```bash
    echo $(htpasswd -nb admin password) | sed -e s/\\$/\\$\\$/g
    ```

- **Database Settings**:

  - `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Database credentials
  - `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string

- **Redis Settings**:

  - `QUEUE_PORT` and `QUEUE_HOST`: Redis queue configuration
  - `CACHE_PORT` and `CACHE_HOST`: Redis cache configuration

- **Network Settings**:

  - `APP_DOMAIN`: Your domain (e.g., `latitude.so`)
  - `APP_URL`: Full URL to your application
  - `GATEWAY_HOSTNAME`: API gateway hostname
  - `GATEWAY_SSL`: Enable/disable SSL

- **Email Configuration**:

  - `MAIL_TRANSPORT`: `smtp`, `mailgun`, `mailpit` - `default` transport is `mailpit`
  - `MAILGUN_EMAIL_DOMAIN`: Email domain for sending emails
  - `FROM_MAILER_EMAIL`: Sender email address
  - `MAILGUN_MAILER_API_KEY`: Mailgun API key (optional)
  - `DISABLE_EMAIL_AUTHENTICATION`: Disable email authentication (optional, default: `false`)

  If `MAIL_TRANSPORT` is set to `smtp`, you must provide the following environment variables:
  
  - `SMTP_HOST`: The SMTP server host (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`)
  - `SMTP_PORT`: The SMTP port number (e.g., `465` for SMTPS or `587` for STARTTLS)
  - `SMTP_SECURE`: Set to `true` for SMTPS (`465`) or `false` for STARTTLS (`587`)
  - `SMTP_USER`: Your email address used for authentication (e.g., `your_email@gmail.com`)
  - `SMTP_PASS`: The password for your email account (use an **app password** if using Gmail)

  Security Considerations:

  **TLS/SSL Encryption**:
   - Ensure that **SMTP** connections use TLS/SSL (via `SMTP_SECURE` set to `true` for SMTPS or `false` for STARTTLS). This is crucial for protecting your email credentials and the contents of your email.
   - Always use a secure connection to prevent the exposure of sensitive data over the network.

- **Storage Configuration**:

  - `DRIVE_DISK`: Choose between `local` or `s3` for file storage

    1. `local` file storage configuration:

    - Files are stored locally on the host machine using Docker volumes.
    - Default variables used:

      ```bash
      # Paths for local storage (optional)
      FILE_STORAGE_ROOT_PATH="/app/storage/files" # e.g /app/storage/files
      FILE_PUBLIC_PATH="files" # e.g files
      FILES_STORAGE_PATH="/app/storage/files" # e.g /app/storage/files
      PUBLIC_FILES_STORAGE_PATH="/app/apps/web/public/files" # e.g /app/storage/public/files (IMPORTANT: has to be in nextjs's public folder)
      ```

    2. `s3` AWS S3 storage configuration:

    - With environment variables (for convenience/legacy):
      You explicitly provide AWS credentials (AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_ACCESS_SECRET) via .env file.
      Required variables:

      ```bash
      AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key-here
      AWS_ACCESS_SECRET=your-secret-here
      AWS_REGION=us-east-1
      S3_BUCKET=app-files-bucket
      PUBLIC_S3_BUCKET=public-files-bucket
      ```

    - AWS S3 with IAM Roles (recommended):
      No explicit AWS keys needed!
      Use IAM Roles attached to your AWS services (ECS, EC2, Lambda).
      Ensure AWS resource has proper IAM Role with S3 access (GetObject, PutObject, DeleteObject).
      Only required environment variables (no keys explicitly stored):

      ```bash
      AWS_REGION=us-east-1
      S3_BUCKET=app-files-bucket
      PUBLIC_S3_BUCKET=public-files-bucket
      ```

      How to configure IAM Role (example):

      1. Go to AWS IAM â†’ Create Role.
      2. Select trusted entity type (e.g., AWS Service).
      3. Attach policy that allows access to required S3 buckets.

      ```json
      {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
          {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
              "s3:GetObject",
              "s3:PutObject",
              "s3:DeleteObject",
              "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name-here",
              "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name-here/*"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

      4. Attach this IAM role to AWS infrastructure (EC2 Instance / ECS Task Definition / Lambda function).

      AWS SDK automatically handles credentials from attached IAM roles.

- **Optional Features**:
  - Sentry integration for error tracking
  - PostHog for analytics

## Starting the Services

1. Start all services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

This will start the following services from public Docker images stored in our
[GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/latitude-dev/packages):

- API Gateway
- Background workers
- Migrations daemon that will run on startup and automatically apply database migrations
- PostgreSQL database on port 5432
- Redis on port 6379
- Traefik (reverse proxy) on ports 80 and 443
- Web application
- WebSocket server

## Service URLs

Once running, you can access:

- Main application: `https://${APP_DOMAIN}` (or `http://${APP_DOMAIN}` if SSL is disabled)
- API Gateway: `https://api.${APP_DOMAIN}`
- WebSocket server: `wss://ws.${APP_DOMAIN}`

## Monitoring

You can monitor the services using standard Docker commands:

```bash
# View service logs
docker compose logs -f [service_name]

# Check service status
docker compose ps

# View resource usage
docker compose top
```

## Important Notes

1. The services use Traefik as a reverse proxy, which automatically handles routing and service discovery.
2. The database data is persisted using a Docker volume mounted at `./docker/pgdata`.
3. If you're using local file storage, note that it requires additional configuration for multi-container setups, and S3 is recommended for production environments.
4. Make sure docker/init-db.sh has execution permissions or otherwise the database container will not start appropiately.
5. For a more robust production environment, make sure to:
   - Set strong passwords in your `.env` file
   - Use appropriate storage configuration (S3 recommended)
   - Set up proper monitoring and logging
   - Use a container orchestrator like Kubernetes, GCP or AWS ECS
