## Prompt

In this example, we define a tool to get the weather. How you obtain the weather is up to youâ€”you might call a third-party service or something within your own system. Once you have the weather information, you return the response to the LLM, and it finishes processing the prompt with that data. You can read more about [tool calling here](/guides/prompt-manager/tools).
