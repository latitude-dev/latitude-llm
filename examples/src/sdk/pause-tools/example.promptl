Plan my trip to {{ destination }} from {{ start_date }} to {{ end_date }}.

# Example response to user
Great! I’m planning your trip to {{ destination }} with your preferences.
This may take a few minutes, as I’ll be gathering up-to-date info from multiple sources. I’ll notify you as soon as your custom itinerary is ready!
